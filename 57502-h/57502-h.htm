<p>Many of the early voyages to the Spanish possessions
in South America, are open to the charge of
having been conducted more upon buccaneering
principles, than on those that should guide nations
in their intercourse with each other.</p>

<p>Even Sir Francis Drake, on his return from one
of the most memorable, endured the mortification
of being considered little better than a pirate, and
it required all the honors conferred on him by
Queen Elizabeth, to set him right in public
opinion.</p>

<p>This is not the proper place to discuss the
question, whether England was justified in allowing
such expeditions to leave her shores; it is
sufficient to state, that our author is not liable
to any animadversion, as his voyage was undertaken
under the authority of the Queen’s commission; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
his conduct was marked throughout by humanity
and benevolence.</p>

<p>We can hardly appreciate too highly the adventurous
daring of these early navigators; but
while we give due credit to them for attempting
such long voyages into almost unknown seas, in
vessels of small burthen, we must not imagine that
they were utterly unprovided for the nature of the
expected service: on the contrary, great care seems
have been taken both in selecting proper crews, and
in providing them with everything needful.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Hawkins, at page 12, alludes generally
to his own preparations; and we read in the accounts
of Sir Francis Drake’s expedition, “that his
vessels were plentifully furnished with all manner of
provisions and necessaries for so long and dangerous
a voyage; and such as served only for ornament
and delight were likewise not forgotten. For this
purpose he took with him very expert musicians
for several instruments. His furniture of all kinds
was rich and sumptuous; all the vessels for his
table, and many in the cook-room, being of pure
silver, curiously wrought, and many other things
whereby the magnificence of his native country
might be displayed.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span></p>

<p>We find even more detail in the <i>North West
Fox, or Fox from the North-west passage</i>, London,
1635: a work professing to give an account of all
Northern voyagers, commencing with King Arthur,
and ending with Captain Luke Fox. We quote
from the preface to the latter voyage:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The ship of his Majesties, was (of my own
chusing, and the best for condition and quality,
especially for this voyage, that the world could
afford), of burthen eighty tonnes, the number of
men twenty, and two boyes, and by all our cares
was sheathed, cordaged, builded, and repaired; all
things being made exactly ready against an appointed
time. My greatest care was to have my men of
godly conversation, and such as their years, of time
not exceeding thirty-five, had gained good experience,
that I might thereby be the better assisted,
especially by such as had been upon those frostbiting
voyages, by which they were hardened for
indurance, and could not so soone be dismayed at
the sight of the ice. For beardless younkers, I
knew as many as could man the boate was enough;
and for all our dependances was upon God alone,
for I had neither private ambition or vaine glory.</p>

<p>“And all these things I had contractedly done by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
the master, wardens, and assistants of the Trinity
House. For a lieutenant I had no use; but it
grieved me much that I could not get one man that
had been on the same voyage before, by whose
counsaile or discourse I might better have shunned
the ice. I was victualled compleatly for eighteene
months; but whether the baker, brewer, butcher,
and other, were master of their arts, or professors
or no, I know not; but this I am sure of, I had
excellent fat beefe, strong beere, good wheaten
bread, good Iceland ling, butter and cheese of the
best, admirable sacke and aqua-vitæ, pease, oatmeale,
wheat-meale, oyle, spice, sugar, fruit, and
rice; with chyrugerie, as sirrups, julips, condits,
trechisses, antidotes, balsoms, gummes, unguents,
implaisters, oyles, potions, suppositors, and purging
pills; and if I wanted instruments, my chyrugion
had enough. My carpenter was fitted from the
thickest bolt to the pumpe nayle, or tacket. The
gunner, from the sacor to the pistol. The boatswaine,
from the cable to the sayle twine. The
steward and cooke, from the caldron to the spoone.</p>

<p>“And for books, if I wanted any I was to blame,
being bountifully furnisht from the treasurer with
money to provide me, especially for those of study
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
there would be no leisure, nor was there, for I
found work enough.”</p>

<p>Besides this abundant preparation of all things
needful for the body, rules for good discipline were
not wanting, which we also transcribe, considering
they have some relation to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>“May 7, anno 1631.&mdash;The voyage of Captaine
Luke Fox, in his Majesties pinnace the <i>Charles</i>,
burthen seventy tonnes, twenty men, and two
boyes, victuals for eighteen months, young Sir
John Wolstenholme being treasurer.</p>

<p>“Orders and articles for civill government, to be
duly observed amongst us in this voyage.</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as the good successe and prosperity
of every action doth consist in the due service and
glorifying of God, knowing that not only our being
and preservation, but the prosperity of all our
actions and enterprizes doe immediately depend
upon His Almighty goodness and mercy; of which
this being none of the least, eyther of nature or
quality. For the better governing and managing
of this present voyage, in his Majesties ship the
<i>Charles</i>, bound for the North-west Passage, towards
the South Sea, May 7, 1631, as followeth:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. That all the whole company, as well officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
as others, shall duly repaire every day twice, at the
call of the bell, to heare publike prayers to be read
(such as are authorized by the Church), and that in
a godly and devout manner, as good Christians
ought.</p>

<p>“2. That no man shall swear by the name of
God, nor use any prophane oath, or blaspheme his
holy name, upon pain of severe punishment.</p>

<p>“3. That no man shall speak any vile or unbeseeming
word, against the honour of his Majestie,
our dread soveraigne, his lawes or ordinances, or
the religion established and authorized by him here
in England, but as good subjects shall duly pray
for him.</p>

<p>“4. That no man shall speake any doubtfull or
despairing words against the good successe of the
voyage, or make any doubt thereof, eyther in publique
or private, at his messe, or to his watch-mate,
or shall make any question of the skill and knowledge
eyther of superiour or inferior officer, or of
the undertakings; nor shall offer to combine against
the authority thereof, upon the paine of severe
punishment, as well to him that shall first heare and
conceale the same, as to the first beginner.</p>

<p>“5. That no man do offer to filch or steale any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
of the goods of the ship or company, or doe offer
to breake into hould, there to take his pleasure of
such provisions as are layd in generall for the whole
company of the ship; nor that any officer appointed
for the charge and oversight thereof, doe other wayes
than shall be appointed him, but shall every man
bee carefull for the necessary preservation of the
victuall and fuell conteyned in the hould; and that
also every officer be so carefull of his store, as hee
must not be found (upon examination) to deserve
punishment.</p>

<p>“6. That no man doe grumble at his allowance
of victuall, or steale any from others, nor shall give
cross language, eyther to superior or equal, in reviling
words or daring speeches, which do tend
to the inflaming of blood or inraging of choller;
remembering this also, that a stroke or a blow is
the breach of his Majesties peace, and may not want
his punishment therefore, as for other reasons.</p>

<p>“7. That at the boatswaine’s call, all the whole
company shall appeare above decke, or else that his
mate fetch up presently all such sloathfull persons,
eyther with rope or cudgell, as in such cases deserves
the same. The quarter-masters shall look into the
steeridge, while the captains, masters, and mates are
at dinner, or at supper.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span></p>

<p>“8. That all men duely observe the watch, as
well at anchor as under sayle, and at the discharge
thereof, the boatswaine or his mate shall call up the
other; all praising God together, with psalme and
prayer. And so committing our selves, both soules
and bodies, ship and goods, to God’s mercifull preservation,
wee beseech him to steere, direct, and
guide us, from the beginning to the end of our
voyage: which hee make prosperous unto us.
Amen.”</p>

<p>Sir Richard Hawkins followed the profession of
a seaman from an early age. Brought up in stirring
times, under the eye of his father, one of the
most experienced naval commanders of his time,
he appears to have inherited a knowledge of sound
principles of discipline, and to have become imbued
with that indomitable courage, tempered with prudence,
essential to the character of a good sea
officer. In 1588, Captain Hawkins commanded the
<i>Swallow</i>, a Queen’s ship of three hundred and sixty
tons, and assisted in her at the destruction of the
Spanish armada. He appears at that period to
have attained a certain consideration, as he was
employed as Queen’s Commissioner, to settle some
prize claims. He next undertook the voyage the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
history of which is recounted in the following pages.
After his return from his detention in the South
Seas, we find him, in 1620, in the <i>Vanguard</i>, of
six hundred and sixty tons, vice-admirall of Sir
Robert Mansel’s expedition against the Algerines.
He died suddenly shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Admiral Burney, in his <i>History of Voyages and
Discoveries in the South Seas</i>, alluding to this work,
says, “it might with propriety have been entitled a
book of good counsel; many of his observations
being unconnected with the voyage he is relating,
but his digressions are ingenious and entertaining,
and they frequently contain useful or curious information”:
and Mr. Barrow, in his <i>Memoirs of the
Naval Worthies of Queen Elizabeth</i>, thinks that
the “<i>Observations</i> must take their station in the
very first rank of our old sea voyages.”</p>

<p>Similar considerations led the council of the
Hakluyt Society to select it, though not exactly a
rare work, for early publication; and it is submitted
to the Members, with a confident hope that it
will repay an attentive perusal.</p>

<p>The editor has confined his labours to reproducing
the text of the original, with only such
slight alterations as were necessary where the sense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
of the author had been obviously marred by a misprint;
giving such explanations of obsolete words
and technical terms as might embarrass an unprofessional
reader; identifying the places visited with
their modern appellation, where practicable; and
adding such remarks as occurred to him while
correcting the proof sheets.</p>

<small>OF</small><br />
SIR RICHARD HAWKINS, KNIGHT,<br />
<small>IN HIS</small><br />
<span class="xx-large">VOYAGE INTO THE SOUTH SEA.</span><br />
</h2>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p>WITH the counsels consent, and helpe of my father,
Sir John Hawkins,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> knight, I resolved a voyage to be made
for the Ilands of Japan, of the Phillippinas, and Molucas,
the kingdomes of China, and East Indies, by the way of
the Straites of Magelan, and the South Sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The necessary
use of
discoveries.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Of travaile.</div>

<p>The principall end of our designements, was, to make a
perfect discovery of all those parts where I should arrive,
as well knowne as unknowne, with their longitudes, and
latitudes; the lying of their coasts; their head-lands;
their ports, and bayes; their cities, townes, and peoplings;
their manner of government; with the commodities which
the countries yeelded, and of which they have want, and
are in necessitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of shipping.</div>

<p>For this purpose in the end of anno 1588, returning
from the journey against the Spanish Armado, I caused a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
ship to be builded in the river of Thames, betwixt three
and foure hundred tunnes, which was finished in that perfection
as could be required; for shee was pleasing to the
eye, profitable for stowage, good of sayle, and well conditioned.</p>

<p>The day of her lanching being appoynted, the Lady
Hawkins (my mother-in-law) craved the naming of the
ship, which was easily granted her: who knowing what
voyage was pretended to be undertaken, named her the
<i>Repentance</i>: what her thoughts were, was kept secret to
her selfe; and although many times I expostulated with
her, to declare the reason for giving her that uncouth name,
I could never have any other satisfaction, then that repentance
was the safest ship we could sayle in, to purchase
the haven of Heaven. Well, I know, shee was no prophetesse,
though a religious and most vertuous lady, and
of a very good understanding.[2]</p>

<p>Yet too propheticall it fell out by Gods secrete judgementes,
which in his wisdome was pleased to reveale unto
us by so unknowne a way, and was sufficient for the
present, to cause me to desist from the enterprise, and to
leave the ship to my father, who willingly tooke her, and
paid the entire charge of the building and furnishing of
her, which I had concorted<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> or paid. And this I did not
for any superstition I have in names, or for that I thinke
them able to further or hinder any thing; for that all
immediately dependeth upon the Providence of Almightie
God, and is disposed by him alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improper
names for
shipping.</div>

<p>Yet advise I all persons ever (as neere as they can) by
all meanes, and in all occasions, to presage unto themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the good they can, and in giving names to terestriall
workes (especially to ships), not to give such as meerly
represent the celestial character; for few have I knowne,
or seen, come to a good end, which have had such attributes.
<span class="sidenote">The <i>Revenge</i></span>
As was plainely seene in the <i>Revenge</i>, which was
ever the unfortunatest ship the late queenes majestie had
during her raigne; for coming out of Ireland, with Sir
John Parrot, shee was like to be cast away upon the
Kentish coast. After, in the voyage of Sir John Hawkins,
my father, anno 1586, shee strucke aground coming into
Plimouth, before her going to sea. Upon the coast of
Spaine, shee left her fleete, readie to sinke with a great
leake: at her returne into the harbour of Plimouth, shee
beate upon Winter stone; and after, in the same voyage,
going out of Portsmouth haven, shee ranne twice aground;
and in the latter of them, lay twentie-two houres beating
upon the shore, and at length, with eight foote of water in
hold, shee was forced off, and presently ranne upon the
Oose: and was cause that shee remained there (with other
three ships of her majesties) six months, till the spring of
the yeare; when coming about to bee decked,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> entring
the river of Thames, her old leake breaking upon her,
had like to have drowned all those which were in her. In
anno 1591, with a storme of wind and weather, riding at her
moorings in the river of Rochester, nothing but her bare
masts over head, shee was turned topse-turvie, her kele
uppermost: and the cost and losse shee wrought, I have
too good cause to remember, in her last voyage, in which
shee was lost, when shee gave England and Spain just
cause to remember her. For the Spaniards themselves
confesse, that three of their ships sunke by her side, and
<span class="sidenote">See Master
Hacluits Relations.</span>
was the death of above 1500 of their men, with the losse
of a great part of their fleete, by a storme which suddainly
tooke them the next day. What English died in her,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
many living are witnesses: amongst which was Sir Richard
Greenfeild,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> a noble and valiant gentleman, vice-admirall
in her of her majesties fleete. So that, well considered,
shee was even a ship loaden, and full fraught with ill
successe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Thunderbolt</i>
of
London.</div>

<p>The like wee might behold in the <i>Thunderbolt</i>, of London,
who, in one voyage (as I remember), had her mast
cleft with a thunderbolt, upon the coast of Barbary. After
in Dartmouth, going for admirall of the Whaftage,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and
guard of the fleete for the river of Bourdieux, had also her
poope blown up with fire sodainly, and unto this day, never
could be knowne the cause, or manner how: and lastly,
shee was burned with her whole companie in the river of
Bourdieux, and Master Edward Wilson, generall in her,
slaine by his enemies, having escaped the fire.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p>The <i>Repentance</i> being put in perfection, and riding at
Detford, the queenes majestie passing by her, to her pallace
of Greenwych, commanded her bargemen to row
round about her, and viewing her from post to stemme,
disliked nothing but her name, and said, that shee would
christen her anew, and that henceforth shee should be
called the <i>Daintie</i>; which name she brooked as well for
her proportion and grace, as for the many happie voyages
shee made in her majesties service; having taken (for her
majestie) a great Bysten,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> of five hundred tunnes, loaden
with iron and other commodities, under the conduct of
Sir Martin Furbusher; a caracke bound for the East
Indies, under my fathers charge, and the principall cause
of taking the great caracke, brought to Dartmouth by Sir
John Borrow, and the Earl of Cumberlands shippes, anno
1592, with others of moment in her other voyages.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> To us,
shee never brought but cost, trouble, and care. Therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
my father resolved to sell her, though with some losse,
which he imparted with me: and for that I had ever a
particular love unto her, and a desire shee should continue
ours, I offered to ease him of the charge and care of her,
and to take her, with all her furniture at the price he had
before taken her of me; with resolution to put in execution
the voyage for which shee was first builded; although
it lay six months and more in suspence, partly, upon the
pretended voyage for Nombrededios and Panama, which
then was fresh a foote; and partly, upon the caracke at
Dartmouth, in which I was imployed as a commissioner;
but this businesse being ended, and the other pretence
waxing colde, the fift of March I resolved, and beganne to
goe forward with the journey, so often talked of, and so
much desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Considerations
for pretended
voyages.</div>

<p>And having made an estimate of the charge of victualls,
munition, imprests,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> sea-store, and necessaries for the sayd
ship; consorting another of an hundred tunnes, which I
waited for daily from the Straites of Giberalter, with a
pynace of sixtie tunnes, all mine owne: and for a competent
number of men for them; as also of all sorts of
marchandises for trade and traffique in all places where
wee should come; I began to wage men, to buy all manner
of victualls and provisions, and to lade her with them,
and with all sorts of commodities (which I could call to
minde) fitting; and dispatched order to my servant in
Plimouth, to put in a readinesse my pynace;<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> as also to take
<span class="sidenote">Provisions
better provided
at Plimouth,
then
at London.</span>
up certaine provisions, which are better cheape in those
parts then in London, as beefe, porke, bisket, and sider.
And with the diligence I used, and my fathers furtherance,
at the end of one moneth, I was ready to set sayle for
Plimouth, to joyne with the rest of my shippes and provisions.
But the expecting of the coming of the lord high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
admirall, Sir Robert Cecill, principall secretary to her
majestie, and Sir Walter Rawley, with others, to honour
my shippe and me with their presence and farewell, detayned
me some dayes; and the rayne and untemperate
weather deprived me of the favour, which I was in hope to
have received at their hands. Whereupon, being loath to
loose more time, and the winde serving according to my
wish, the eight of April, 1593, I caused the pilot to set
sayle from Blackwall, and to vayle<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> down to Gravesend,
whether that night I purposed to come.</p>

<p>Having taken my unhappy last leave of my father Sir
John Hawkins, I tooke my barge, and rowed down the
river, and coming to Barking, wee might see my ship at
an anchor in the midst of the channell, where ships are
not wont to more themselves: this bred in me some alteration.
And coming aboord her, one and other began to
recount the perill they had past of losse of ship and goods,
which was not little; for the winde being at east north-east,
when they set sayle, and vered out southerly, it
forced them for the doubling of a point to bring their
tacke aboard, and looffing up; the winde freshing, sodenly
the shipp began to make a little hele; and for that shee
was very deepe loaden, and her ports open, the water began
to enter in at them, which no bodie having regard
<span class="sidenote">Note.</span>
unto, thinking themselves safe in the river, it augmented
in such maner as the waight of the water began to presse
downe the side, more then the winde: at length when it
was seene and the shete flowne, shee could hardly be
brought upright. But God was pleased that with the diligence
and travell of the company, shee was freed of that
danger; which may be a gentle warning<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> to all such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
take charge of shipping, even before they set sayle, eyther
in river or harbour, or other part, to have an eye to their
ports, and to see those shut and callked, which may cause
danger; for avoyding the many mishaps which dayly
chance for the neglect thereof, and have beene most lamentable
spectacles and examples unto us: experiments
in the <i>Great Harry</i>, admirall<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> of England, which was over-set
and suncke at Portsmouth, with her captaine, Carew,
and the most part of his company drowned in a goodly
summers day, with a little flawe of winde; for that her
ports were all open, and making a small hele, by them
entred their destruction; where if they had beene shut, no
wind could have hurt her, especially in that place.</p>

<p>In the river of Thames, Master Thomas Candish had a
small ship over-set through the same negligence. And one
of the fleete of Syr Francis Drake, in Santo Domingo harbour,
turned her keele upward likewise, upon the same
occasion; with many others, which we never have knowledge
of.</p>

<p>And when this commeth to passe, many times negligence
is cloaked with the fury of the winde: which is a
double fault; for the truth being knowne, others would
bee warned to shun the like neglects; for it is a very bad
ship whose masts crackt not asunder, whose sayles and
tackling flie not in peeces, before she over-set, especially
if shee be English built. And that which over-setteth the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
ship is the waight of the water that presseth down the side,
which as it entreth more and more, increaseth the waight,
and the impossibilitie of the remedie: for, the water not
entring, with easing of the sheate, or striking the sayles,
or putting the ship before the winde or sea, or other diligences,
as occasion is offered (and all expert mariners
know) remedie is easily found.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>With this mischaunce the mariners were so daunted, that
they would not proceede with the ship any further, except
shee was lighted, which indeede was needelesse, for many
reasons which I gave: but mariners are like to a stiffe
necked horse, which taking the bridle betwixt his teeth,
forceth his rider to what him list, mauger his will; so they
having once concluded, and resolved, are with great difficultie
brought to yeelde to the raynes of reason; and to
colour their negligence, they added cost, trouble, and delay.
In fine, seeing no other remedie, I dispatched that
night a servant of mine to give account to my father of
that which had past, and to bring mee presently some
barke of London, to goe along with me to Plimouth;
which not finding, he brought me a hoye, in which I
loaded some sixe or eight tunnes, to give content to the
company; and so set sayle the 13th of Aprill, and the next
day wee put in at Harwich, for that the winde was contrary,
and from thence departed the 18th of the sayd
moneth in the morning.</p>

<p>When wee were cleere of the sands, the winde veered to
the south-west, and so we were forced to put into Margat
Roade, whether came presently after us a fleete of Hollanders
of above an hundreth sayle, bound for Rochell, to
loade salt; and in their companie a dozen shippes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
warre; their wafters very good ships and well appointed in
all respects. All which came alongst by our ship, and saluted
us, as is the custome of the sea, some with three,
others with five, others with more peeces of ordinance.</p>

<p>The next morning the winde vering easterly, I set sayle,
and the Hollanders with me, and they with the flood in
hand, went out at the North-sands-head, and I through
the Gulls to shorten my way, and to set my pilate ashore.</p>

<p>Comming neere the South-fore-land, the winde began to
vere to the south-east and by south, so as we could not
double the point of the land, and being close abourd the
shore, and puting our ship to stay, what with the chapping
sea, and what with the tide upon the bowe, shee mist staying,
and put us in some danger, before we could flatt
<span class="sidenote">Note.</span>
about; therefore for doubling the point of any land better
is ever a short bourd, then to put all in perill.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Being tacked about, wee thought to anchor in the
Downes, but the sayles set, we made a small bourd, and
after casting about agayne, doubled the foreland, and ran
alongst the coast till we came to the Isle of Wight: where
being becalmed, wee sent ashore Master Thomson, of Harwich,
our pilot, not being able before to set him on shore
for the perversnes of the winde.</p>

<p>Being cleere of the Wight, the winde vered southerly,
and before we came to Port-land, to the west, south-west,
but with the helpe of the ebbe wee recovered Port-land-roade,
where we anchored all that night; and the next
morning with the ebbe, wee set sayle againe, the winde at
west south-west; purposing to beare it up, all the ebbe,
and to stop the flood being under sayle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The providence
of the
Dutch.</div>

<p>The fleete of Flemings which had beene in our company
before, came towring into the road, which certainly was a
thing worth the noting, to behold the good order the
masters observed in guard of their fleete.</p>

<p>The admirall headmost, and the rest of the men of
warre, spread alongst to wind-ward, all saving the vice-admirall
and her consort, which were lee-most and stern-most
of all; and except the admirall, which was the first,
that came to an anchor, none of the other men of warre
anchored, before all the fleete was in safetie; and then
they placed themselves round about the fleete; the vice-admirall
seamost and leemost; which we have taught unto
most nations, and they observe it now a dayes better then
we, to our shame, that being the authors and reformers of
<span class="sidenote">The English
authors of
sea discipline.</span>
the best discipline and lawes in sea causes, are become
those which doe now worst execute them.</p>

<p>And I cannot gather whence this contempt hath growne,
<span class="sidenote">By them
againe neglected.</span>
except of the neglect of discipline, or rather in giving
commands for favour to those, which want experience of
what is committed to their charge: or that there hath
beene little curiositie in our countrey in writing of the
discipline of the sea; which is not lesse necessary for us,
then that of the law; and I am of opinion, that the want
of experience is much more tollerable in a generall by
land, then in a governour by sea: for in the field, the
lieutenant generall, the sergeant major, and the coronels
supply what is wanting in the generall, for that they all
command, and ever there is place for counsell, which in
the sea by many accidents is denied; and the head is he
that manageth all, in whom alone if there be defect, all
is badly governed, for, by ignorance how can errors be
judged or reformed? And therefore I wish all to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
upon them that which they understand, and refuse the
contrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The modesty
of Sir
Henry Palmer.</div>

<p>As Sir Henry Palmer, a wise and valiant gentleman, a
great commander, and of much experience in sea causes,
being appoynted by the queens majesties counsell, to goe
for generall of a fleete for the coast of Spaine, anno 1583,
submitting himselfe to their lordships pleasure, excused
the charge, saying, that his trayning up had beene in the
narrow seas; and that of the other he had little experience:
and therefore was in dutie bound to intreate their honours
to make choice of some other person, that was better acquainted
and experimented in those seas; that her majestie
and their lordships might be the better served. His
modestie and discretion is doubtlesse to be had in remembrance
and great estimation; for the ambition of
many which covet the command of fleetes, and places of
government (not knowing their compasse, nor how, nor
what to command) doe purchase to themselves shame;
and losse to those that employ them: being required in a
<span class="sidenote">Parts required
in a
commander
at sea.</span>
commander at sea, a sharpe wit, a good understanding,
experience in shipping, practise in management of sea
business, knowledge in navigation, and in command. I
hold it much better to deserve it, and not to have it, then
to have it not deserving it.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION IV.</h3>

<p>The fruits and inconveniences of the latter we daily partake
of, to our losse and dishonor. As in the fleete that
<span class="sidenote">The losse of
the Burdieux
fleete
anno 1592.</span>
went for Burdieux, anno 1592, which had six gallant ships
for wafters. At their going out of Plimouth, the vice-admirall,
that should have beene starnmost of all, was the
headmost, and the admirall the last, and he that did execute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the office of the vice-admirall, lanching off into the
sea, drew after him the greater part of the fleete, and night
comming on, and both bearing lights, caused a separation:
so that the head had a quarter of the bodie, and
the fleete three quarters, and he that should goe before,
came behinde. Whereof ensued, that the three parts
meeting with a few Spanish men of warre, wanting their
head, were a prey unto them. For the vice-admirall, and
other wafters, that should be the shepheards to guard
and keepe their flocke, and to carry them in safetie before
them, were headmost, and they the men who made most
<span class="sidenote">The cause.</span>
hast to flie from the wolfe. Whereas if they had done as
they ought, in place of losse and infamie, they had gained
honor and reward.</p>

<p>This I have beene enformed of by the Spanish and
English, which were present in the occasion. And a ship
of mine, being one of the starnmost, freed her selfe, for
that shee was in warlike manner, with her false netting,
many pendents and streamers, and at least sixteen or eight-teen
peeces of artillery; the enemie thinking her to be a
wafter, or ship of warre, not one of them durst lay her
aboord: and this the master and company vaunted of at
their returne.</p>

<p>In the same voyage, in the river of Burdieux (as is
credibly reported), if the six wafters had kept together,
they had not onely not received domage, but gotten much
<span class="sidenote">The weakness
of the

honour and reputation. For the admirall of the Spanish
armado, was a Flemish shippe of not above 130 tunnes,
and the rest flie-boates<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and small shipping, for the most
part.</p>

<p>And although there were twenty-two sayle in all, what
manner of ships they were, and how furnished and appoynted,
is well knowne, with the difference.

<div class="sidenote">The voyage
of Sir John
Hawkins
anno 1590.</div>

<p>In the fleete of her majestie, under the charge of my
father Sir John Hawkins, anno 1590, upon the coast of
Spaine, the vice-admirall being a head one morning, where
his place was to be a sterne, lost us the taking of eight men
of warre loaden with munition, victuals, and provisions,
for the supplie of the souldiers in Brittaine: and although
they were seven or eight leagues from the shore, when our
vice-admirall began to fight with them, yet for that the
rest of our fleete were some four, some five leagues, and
some more distant from them, when we beganne to give
chase, the Spaniards recovered into the harbour of Monge,
before our admirall could come up to give direction; yet
well beaten, with losse of above two hundreth men, as they
themselves confessed to me after.</p>

<p>And doubtlesse, if the wind had not over-blowne, and
that to follow them I was forced to shut all my lower
ports, the ship I undertooke doubtles had never endured
to come to the port; but being doubble fli-boates, and
all of good sayle, they bare for their lives, and we what
we could to follow and fetch them up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Richard

<p>In this poynt, at the Ile of Flores, Sir Richard Greenfield
got eternall honour and reputation of great valour,
and of an experimented souldier, chusing rather to sacrifice
his life, and to passe all danger whatsoever, then to
fayle in his obligation, by gathering together those which
had remained a shore in that place, though with the hazard
of his ship and companie; and rather we ought to imbrace
an honourable death, then to live with infamie and dishonour,
by fayling in dutie; and I account, that he and
his country got much honor in that occasion; for one ship,
and of the second sort of her majesties, sustained the force
of all the fleete of Spain, and gave them to understand,
that they be impregnible, for having bought deerely the
boording of her, divers and sundry times, and with many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
joyntly, and with a continuall fight of fourteen or sixteen
houres, at length leaving her without any mast standing, and
like a logge in the seas, shee made, notwithstanding, a most
honourable composition of life and libertie for above two
hundreth and sixtie men, as by the pay-booke appeareth:
which her majestie of her free grace, commanded, in recompence
of their service, to be given to every one his six
moneths wages. All which may worthily be written in our
chronicles in letters of gold, in memory for all posterities,
some to beware, and others, by their example in the like
occasions, to imitate the true valour of our nation in these
ages.</p>

succour which he was able; although some doe say, and I
consent with them, that the best valour is to obey, and to

better than sacrifice. Yet in some occasions, where there

<h3>SECTION V.</h3>

<p>Being cleare of the race of Portland, the wind began to
suffle<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> with fogge and misling rayne, and forced us to a
short sayle, which continued with us three dayes; the
wind never veering one poynt, nor the fogge suffering us
to see the coast.</p>

<p>The third day in the fogge, we met with a barke of
Dartmouth, which came from Rochell, and demanding of
them if they had made any land, answered, that they had
onely seene the Edie stone that morning, which lyeth
thwart of the sound of Plimouth, and that Dartmouth (as
they thought) bare off us north north-east: which seemed
strange unto us; for we made account that we were
thwart of Exmouth. Within two houres after, the weather
beganne to cleare up, and we found ourselves thwart of
the Berry, and might see the small barke bearing into
Torbay, having over-shot her port; which error often
happeneth to those that make the land in foggie weather,
and use not good diligence by sound, by lying off the
land, and other circumstances, to search the truth; and is
cause of the losse of many a ship, and the sweet lives of
multitudes of men.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>That evening we anchored in the range of Dartmouth,
till the floud was spent; and the ebbe come, wee set sayle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
againe. And the next morning early, being the 26th of
Aprill, wee harboured our selves in Plimouth.</p>

<p>My ship at an anchor, and I ashore, I presently dispatched
a messenger to London, to advise my father, Sir
John Hawkins, what had past: which, not onely to him,
but to all others, that understood what it was, seemed
strange; that the wind contrary, and the weather such as
it had beene, wee could be able to gaine Plimouth; but
doubtlesse, the <i>Daintie</i> was a very good sea ship, and excellent
by the winde; which with the neap streames, and
our diligence to benefit our selves of all advantages, made
fezible that which almost was not to be beleeved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parts requisite
in a good
mariner.</div>

<p>And in this occasion, I found by experience, that one of
the principall parts required in a mariner that frequenteth
our coastes of England, is to cast his tydes, and to know
how they set from poynt to poynt, with the difference of
those in the channell from those of the shore.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION VI.</h3>

<p>Now presently I began to prepare for my dispatch, and to
hasten my departure; and finding that my ship which I
expected from the Straites, came not, and that shee was
to goe to London to discharge, and uncertaine how long
shee might stay, I resolved to take another of mine owne
in her place, though lesser, called the <i>Hawke</i>, onely for a
victualler; purposing in the coast of Brasill, or in the
Straites,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> to take out her men and victualls, and to cast her
off.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION VII.</h3>

<p>With my continuall travell, the helpe of my good friends,
and excessive charge (which none can easily beleeve, but
those which have prooved it), towardes the end of May,
I was readie to set sayle with my three ships, drawne
out into the sound, and began to gather my company
aboord.</p>

<p>The 28th of May (as I remember) began a storme of
winde, westerly; the two lesser shippes presently harboured
themselves, and I gave order to the master of the
<i>Daintie</i> (called Hugh Cornish), one of the most sufficientest
men of his coate, to bring her also into Catt-water, which
he laboured to doe; but being neere the mouth of the
harbour, and doubting least the anchor being weighed,
the ship might cast the contrary way, and so run on some
perill, entertained himselfe a while in laying out a warpe,
and in the meane time, the wind freshing, and the ship
riding by one anchor, brake the flooke of it, and so forced
them to let fall another; by which, and by the warpe they
<span class="sidenote">A cruell
storme.</span>
had layd out, they rydd. The storme was such, as being
within hearing of those upon the shore, we were not able
by any meanes to send them succour, and the second day
of the storme, desiring much to goe aboord, there joined
with me captaine William Anthony, captaine John Ellis,
<span class="sidenote">And therein
the effects of
courage and
advice.</span>
and master Henry Courton, in a light horsman<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> which I
had: all men exercised in charge, and of valour and sufficiencie,
and from their youth bred up in businesse of the
sea: which notwithstanding, and that wee laboured what
we could, for the space of two houres against waves and
wind, we could finde no possibilitie to accomplish our
desire; which seene, we went aboord the other shippes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
and put them in the best securitie wee could. Thus busied,
we might see come driving by us the mayne mast of the
<i>Daintie</i>, which made me to feare the worst, and so hasted
a shore, to satisfie my longing.</p>

<p>And comming upon Catt-downe, wee might see the ship
heave and sett, which manifestly shewed the losse of the
mast onely, which was well imployed; for it saved the ship,
men, and goods. For had shee driven a ships length
more, shee had (no doubt) beene cast away; and the men
in that place could not chuse but run into danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The losse of
the pynace.</div>

<p>Comming to my house to shift me (for that we were all
wett to the skinne), I had not well changed my clothes,
when a servant of mine, who was in the pynace at my
comming ashore, enters almost out of breath, with newes,
that shee was beating upon the rocks, which though I
knew to be remedilesse, I put my selfe in place where I
might see her, and in a little time after shee sunk downe
right. These losses and mischances troubled and grieved,
but nothing daunted me; for common experience taught
me, that all honourable enterprises are accompanied with
difficulties and daungers; <i>Si fortuna me tormenta; Esperança
me contenta</i>:<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> of hard beginnings, many times
come prosperous and happy events. And although, a well-willing
friend wisely foretold me them to be presages of
future bad successe, and so disswaded me what lay in him
with effectual reasons, from my pretence, yet the hazard
of my credite, and danger of disreputation, to take in hand
that which I should not prosecute by all meanes possible,
was more powerfull to cause me to goe forwardes, then his
grave good counsell to make me desist. And so the
storme ceasing, I beganne to get in the <i>Daintie</i>, to mast
her a-new, and to recover the <i>Fancy</i>, my pynace, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
with the helpe and furtherance of my wives father, who
supplyed all my wants, together with my credit (which I
thanke God was unspotted), in ten dayes put all in his
former estate, or better. And so once againe, in Gods
name, I brought my shippes out into the sound, the wind
being easterly, and beganne to take my leave of my friends,
and of my dearest friend, my second selfe, whose unfeyned
teares had wrought me into irresolution, and sent some
other in my roome, had I not considered that he that is
in the daunce, must needs daunce on, though he doe but
hopp, except he will be a laughing stocke to all the lookers
on: so remembering that many had their eyes set upon
me, with diverse affections, as also the hope of good successe
(my intention being honest and good), I shut the
doore to all impediments, and mine eare to all contrary
counsell, and gave place to voluntary banishment from all
that I loved and esteemed in this life, with hope thereby
better to serve my God, my prince, and countrie, then to
encrease my tallent any way.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abuses of
some sea-faring
men.</div>

<p>And so began to gather my companie aboord, which
occupied my good friends and the justices of the towne
two dayes, and forced us to search all lodgings, tavernes,
and ale-houses. (For some would be ever taking their
leave and never depart):<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> some drinke themselves so drunke,
that except they were carried aboord, they of themselves
were not able to goe one steppe: others, knowing the
necessity of the time, fayned themselves sicke: others, to
be indebted to their hostes, and forced me to ransome
them; one, his chest; another, his sword; another, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
shirts; another, his carde<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and instruments for sea: and
others, to benefit themselves of the imprest given them,
absented themselves, making a lewd living in deceiving
all, whose money they could lay hold of; which is a
scandall too rife amongst our sea-men; by it they committing
three great offences: 1, Robbery of the goods of
another person; 2, breach of their faith and promise;
3, and hinderance (with losse of time) unto the voyage;
all being a common injury to the owners, victuallers, and
company; which many times hath beene an utter overthrow
and undoing to all in generall. An abuse in our
common-wealth necessarily to be reformed; and as a person
that hath both seene, and felt by experience, these
inconveniences, I wish it to be remedied; for, I can but
wonder, that the late lord high admirall of England, the
late Earle of Cumberland; and the Lord Thomas Howard,
now Earle of Suffolke, being of so great authoritie, having
to their cost and losse so often made experience of the inconveniences
of these lewd proceedings, have not united
their goodnesses and wisedomes to redress this dis-loyall
and base absurditie of the vulgar.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Master
Thomas
Candish.</div>

<p>Master Thomas Candish,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> in his last voyage, in the
sound of Plimmouth, being readie to set sayle, complained
unto me, that persons which had absented themselves in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
imprests, had cost him above a thousand and five hundred
pounds: these varlets, within a few dayes after his
departure, I saw walking the streets of Plimouth, whom
the justice had before sought for with great diligence; and
without punishment. And therefore it is no wonder that
others presume to doe the like. <i>Impunitas peccandi
illecebra.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Master
George
Reymond.</div>

<p>The like complaint made master George Reymond; and
in what sort they dealt with me is notorious, and was such,
that if I had not beene provident to have had a third part
more of men then I had need of, I had beene forced to goe
to the sea unmanned; or to give over my voyage. And
many of my company, at sea, vaunted how they had
cosoned the Earle of Cumberland, master Candish, master
Reymond, and others; some of five poundes, some of ten,
some of more, and some of lesse. And truely, I thinke,
my voyage prospered the worse, for theirs and other lewd
persons company, which were in my ship; which, I thinke,
might be redressed by some extraordinary, severe, and
present justice, to be executed on the offenders by the
justice in that place where they should be found. And
for finding them, it were good that all captaines, and
masters of shippes, at their departure out of the port,
should give unto the head justice, the names and signes of
all their runnawayes, and they presently to dispatch to the
nigher ports the advise agreeable, where meeting with
them, without further delay or processe, to use martial
law upon them. Without doubt, seeing the law once put
in execution, they and all others would be terrified from
such villanies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inconvenience
of
imprests.</div>

<p>It might be remedied also by utter taking away of all
imprests, which is a thing lately crept into our common-wealth,
and in my opinion, of much more hurt then good
unto all; and although my opinion seeme harsh, it being
a deed of charitie to helpe the needy (which I wish ever to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
be exercised, and by no meanes will contradict), yet for
that such as goe to the sea (for the most part) consume
that money lewdly before they depart (as common experience
teacheth us): and when they come from sea, many
times come more beggerly home then when they went
forth, having received and spent their portion before they
imbarked themselves; and having neither rent nor maintenance
more then their travell, to sustaine themselves,
are forced to theeve, to cozen, or to runne away in debt.
Besides, many times it is an occasion to some to lye upon
a voyage a long time; whereas, if they had not that imprest,
they might perhaps have gayned more in another
imployment, and have beene at home agayne, to save that
which they waite for. For these, and many more weightie
reasons, I am still bold, to maintaine my former assertions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true use
of imprests.</div>

<p>Those onely used in his majesties shippes I comprehend
not in this my opinion: neither the imprests made to
married men, which would be given to their wives monethly
in their absence, for their reliefe. For that is well
knowne, that all which goe to the sea now a-dayes, are
provided of foode, and house-roome, and all things
necessary, during the time of their voyage; and, in all
long voyages, of apparell also: so that nothing is to be
spent during the voyage. That money which is wont
to be cast away in imprestes, might be imployed in
apparell, and necessaries at the sea, and given to those
that have need, at the price it was bought, to be deducted
out of their shares or wages at their returne, which is
reasonable and charitable. This course taken, if any
would runne away, in God’s name fare him well.</p>

<p>Some have a more colourable kinde of cunning to abuse
men, and to sustaine themselves. Such will goe to sea
with all men, and goe never from the shore. For as long
as boord wages last, they are of the company, but those
taking end, or the ship in readinesse, they have one excuse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
or other, and thinke themselves no longer bound, but
whilst they receive money, and then plucke their heads
out of the coller. An abuse also worthie to be reformed.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION VIII.</h3>

<p>The greater part of my companie gathered aboord, I set
sayle the 12th of June 1593, about three of the clocke in
the afternoon, and made a bourd or two off and in, wayting
the returne of my boat, which I had sent a-shore, for dispatch
of some businesse: which being come aboord, and
all put in order, I looft<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> near the shore, to give my farewell
to all the inhabitants of the towne, whereof the most part
were gathered together upon the Howe, to shew their
gratefull correspondency, to the love and zeale which I,
my father, and predecessors, have ever borne to that place,
as to our naturall and mother towne. And first with my
noyse of trumpets, after with my waytes,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and then with
my other musicke, and lastly, with the artillery of my
shippes, I made the best signification I could of a kinde
farewell. This they answered with the waytes of the
towne, and the ordinance on the shore, and with shouting
of voyces; which with the fayre evening and silence of the
night, were heard a great distance off. All which taking
<span class="sidenote">The consequence
of
instructions
at departure.</span>
end, I sent instructions and directions to my other ships.
Which is a poynt of speciall importance; for that I have
seene commanders of great name and reputation, by neglect
and omission of such solemnities, to have runne into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
many inconveniences, and thereby have learnt the necessitie
of it. Whereby I cannot but advise all such as shall
have charge committed unto them, ever before they depart
out of the port, to give unto their whole fleete, not onely
directions for civill government, but also where, when, and
how to meete, if they should chance to loose company, and
the signes how to know one another a-far off, with other
poynts and circumstances, as the occasions shall minister
matter different, at the discretion of the wise commander.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>But some may say unto me, that in all occasions it is
not convenient to give directions: for that if the enemy
happen upon any of the fleete, or that there be any treacherous
person in the company, their designments may be
discovered, and so prevented.</p>

<p>To this I answere, that the prudent governour, by good
consideration may avoyde this, by publication of that
which is good and necessarie for the guide of his fleete
and people; by all secret instructions, to give them sealed,
and not to be opened, but comming to a place appoynted
(after the manner of the Turkish direction to the Bashawes,
who are their generalls); and in any eminent perill to cast
them by the boord, or otherwise to make away with them.
For he that setteth sayle, not giving directions in writing
to his fleete, knoweth not, if the night or day following, he
may be separated from his company; which happeneth
sometimes: and then, if a place of meeting be not knowne,
he runneth in danger not to joyne them together agayne.</p>

<p>And for places of meeting, when seperation happeneth,
I am of opinion, to appoynt the place of meeting in such a
height, twentie, or thirtie, or fortie leagues off the land, or
iland. East or west is not so fitting, if the place affoord
it, as some sound betwixt ilands, or some iland, or harbour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Objections
against
meeting in
harbours.</div>

<p>It may be alleged in contradiction, and with probable
reason, that it is not fit for a fleete to stay in a harbour
for one ship, nor at an anchor at an iland, for being discovered,
or for hinderance of their voyage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Answered.</div>

<p>Yet it is the best; for when the want is but for one or
two ships, a pynace or ship may wayte the time appoynted
and remaine with direction for them. But commonly one
ship, though but a bad sayler, maketh more haste then a
whole fleete, and is at the meeting place first, if the accident
be not very important.</p>

<p>The place of meeting, if it might be, would be able to
give, at the least, refreshing of water and wood.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION IX.</h3>

<p>Lanching out into the channell, the wind being at east
and by south, and east south-east, which blowing hard,
and a flood in hand, caused a chapping sea, and my vice-admirall
bearing a good sayle made some water, and
shooting off a peece of ordinance, I edged towardes her, to
know the cause; who answered me, that they had sprung
a great leake, and that of force they must returne into the
sound; which seeing to be necessary, I cast about, where
anchoring, and going aboord, presently found, that betwixt
<span class="sidenote">False calking.</span>
wind and water, the calkers had left a seame uncalked,
which being filled up with pitch only, the sea
labouring that out, had been sufficient to have sunk her
in short space, if it had not beene discovered in time.</p>

<p>And truely there is little care used now adaies amongst
our countrimen in this profession, in respect of that which
was used in times past, and is accustomed in France, in
Spaine, and in other parts. Which necessitie will cause
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to be reformed in time, by assigning the portion that
every workeman is to calke; that if there be damage
through his default, he may be forced to contribute
towards the losse occasioned through his negligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For prevention
thereof.</div>

<p>And for more securitie I hold it for a good custome used
in some parts, in making an end of calking and pitching

undoubtedly discover the defect, for no pitcht place without
calking, can suffer the force and peaze<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> of the water.
In neglect whereof, I have seene great damage and danger
<span class="sidenote">Example.</span>
to ensue. The <i>Arke Royall</i> of his majesties, may serve
for an example: which put all in daunger at her first going
to the sea, by a trivuell hole left open in the post,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and
covered only with pitch. In this point no man can be too
circumspect, for it is the security of ship, men and goods.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>This being remedied, I set sayle in the morning, and ran
south-west, till we were cleere of Ushent; and then south
south-west, till we were some hundred leagues off, where
wee met with a great hulke, of some five or six hundred
tunnes, well appointed, the which my company (as is naturall
to all mariners), presently would make a prize, and
loaden with Spaniard’s goods; and without speaking to her,
wished that the gunner might shoote at her, to cause her
<span class="sidenote">Advise for
shooting at
sea.</span>
to amaine.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Which is a bad custome received and used of
many ignorant persons, presently to gun at all whatsoever
they discover, before they speake with them; being contrary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
to all discipline, and many times is cause of dissention
betwixt friends, and the breach of amitie betwixt
princes; the death of many, and sometimes losse of shippes
and all, making many obstinate, if not desperate; whereas
in using common courtesie, they would better bethinke
themselves, and so with ordinarie proceeding (justified by
reason, and the custome of all well disciplined people)
might perhaps many times breede an increase of amitie, a
succour to necessity, and excuse divers inconveniencies and
sutes, which have impoverished many: for it hath chanced
<span class="sidenote">Sundry mischances
for
neglect
thereof.</span>
by this errour, that two English ships, neither carrying
flag for their perticular respects, to change each with other
a dozen payre of shott, with hurt to both, being after too
late to repent their follie. Yea a person of credit hath
told mee, that two English men of warre in the night, have
layed each other aboord willingly, with losse of many men
and dammage to both, onely for the fault of not speaking
one to the other; which might seeme to carrie with it some
excuse, if they had beene neere the shore, or that the one
had beene a hull,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and the other under sayle, in feare shee
should have escaped, not knowing what shee was (though
in the night it is no wisedome to bourd with any ship), but
in the maine sea, and both desiring to joyne, was a sufficient
declaration that both were seekers: and therefore by
day or night, he that can speake with the ship hee seeth,
is bound, upon payne to bee reputed voyd of good government,
to hayle her before hee shoote at her. Some man
<span class="sidenote">Object.</span>
may say, that in the meanetime, shee might gaine the
winde: in such causes, and many others, necessity giveth
<span class="sidenote">Answer.</span>
exception to all lawes; and experience teacheth what is
fit to be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Master
Thomas
Hampton.</div>

<p>Master Thomas Hampton, once generall of a fleete of
wafters, sent to Rochell, anno 1585, with secret instructions,
considering (and as a man of experience), wisely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
understanding his place and affaires, in like case shut his
eare to the instigations and provocations of the common
sort, preferring the publique good of both kingdomes before
his owne reputation with the vulgar people: and as
another Fabius Maximus, <i>cunctando restituit rem, non ponendo
<span class="sidenote">The French
and English
fleete salute
one another.</span>
rumores ante salutem</i>. The French kings fleete
comming where he was, and to winde-ward of him, all his
company were in an uproare; for that hee would not
shoote presently at them, before they saw their intention:
wherein had beene committed three great faults: the first
and principall, the breach of amitie betwixt the princes and
kingdomes: the second, the neglect of common curtesie, in
shooting before hee had spoken with them: and the third,
in shooting first, being to lee-wards of the other.</p>

<p>Besides, there was no losse of reputation, because the
French kings fleete was in his owne sea; and therefore for
it to come to winde-ward, or the other to go to lee-ward,
was but that which in reason was required, the kingdomes
being in peace and amitie. For every prince is to be acknowledged
and respected in his jurisdiction, and where
hee pretendeth it to be his.</p>

<p>The French generall likewise seemed well to understand
what he had in hand; for though he were farre superiour
in forces, yet used hee the termes which were required;
and comming within speech, hayled them, and asked if
there were peace or warre betwixt England and France:
whereunto answere being made that they knew of no other
but peace, they saluted each other after the maner of the
sea, and then came to an anchor all together, and as friends
visited each other in their ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English
carry up
their flag in
the French
seas.</div>

<p>One thing the French suffered (upon what occasion or
ground I know not), that the English alwayes carried their
flag displayed; which in all other partes and kingdomes is
not permitted: at least, in our seas, if a stranger fleete
meete with any of his majesties ships, the forraigners are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
bound to take in their flags, or his majesties ships to force
them to it, though thereof follow the breach of peace or
whatsoever discommodity. And whosoever should not be
jealous in this point, hee is not worthy to have the commaund
of a cock-boat committed unto him: yea no
<span class="sidenote">The honour
of his majesties
ships.</span>
stranger ought to open his flag in any port of England,
where there is any shipp or fort of his majesties, upon
penaltie to loose his flagg, and to pay for the powder and
shott spend upon him. Yea, such is the respect to his
majesties shippes in all places of his dominions, that no
English ship displayeth the flagge in their presence, but
runneth the like daunger, except they be in his majesties
service; and then they are in predicament of the kings
ships. Which good discipline in other kingdomes is not
in that regard as it ought, but sometimes through ignorance,
sometimes of malice, neglect is made of that dutie
and acknowledgement which is required, to the cost and
shame of the ignorant and malicious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Practised at
the comming
in of King
Philip into
England.</div>

<p>In queen Maries raigne, king Philip of Spaine, comming
to marry with the queene, and meeting with the
royall navie of England, the lord William Haward, high
admirall of England, would not consent, that the king in
the narrow seas should carrie his flagge displayed, untill he
came into the harbour of Plimouth.</p>

<p>I being of tender yeares, there came a fleete of Spaniards
<span class="sidenote">And in the
passage of
Dona Anna
de Austria.</span>
of above fiftie sayle of shippes, bound for Flaunders, to fetch
the queen, Donna Anna de Austria, last wife to Philip the
second of Spaine, which entred betwixt the iland and the
maine, without vayling their top-sayles, or taking in of
their flags: which my father, Sir John Hawkins, (admirall
of a fleete of her majesties shippes, then ryding in Catt-water),
perceiving, commanded his gunner to shoot at the
flagge of the admirall, that they might thereby see their
error: which, notwithstanding, they persevered arrogantly
to keepe displayed; whereupon the gunner at the next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
shott, lact<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> the admirall through and through, whereby the
Spaniards finding that the matter beganne to grow to
earnest, tooke in their flags and top-sayles, and so ranne
to an anchor.</p>

<p>The generall presently sent his boat, with a principall
personage to expostulate the cause and reason of that proceeding;
but my father would not permit him to come
into his ship, nor to heare his message; but by another
gentleman commanded him to returne, and to tell his
generall, that in as much as in the queenes port and
chamber, he had neglected to doe the acknowledgment
and reverence which all owe unto her majestie (especially
her ships being present), and comming with so great a
navie, he could not but give suspition by such proceeding
of malicious intention, and therefore required him, that
within twelve houres he should depart the port, upon paine
to be held as a common enemy, and to proceed against him
with force.</p>

<p>Which answere the generall understanding, presently
imbarked himselfe in the same boat, and came to the
<i>Jesus of Lubecke</i>, and craved licence to speake with my
father; which at the first was denyed him, but upon the
second intreatie was admitted to enter the ship, and to
parley. The Spanish generall began to demand if there
were warres betwixt England and Spaine; who was answered,
that his arrogant manner of proceeding, usurping
the queene his mistresses right, as much as in him lay,
had given sufficient cause for breach of the peace, and that
he purposed presently to give notice thereof to the queene
and her counsell, and in the meane time, that he might
depart. Whereunto the Spanish generall replyed, that he
knew not any offence he had committed, and that he
would be glad to know wherein he had misbehaved himselfe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
My father seeing he pretended to escape by ignorance,
beganne to put him in mind of the custome of
Spaine and Fraunce, and many other parts, and that he
could by no meanes be ignorant of that, which was common
right to all princes in their kingdomes; demanding, if a
fleete of England should come into any port of Spaine (the
kings majesties ships being present), if the English should
carry their flags in the toppe, whether the Spanish would
not shoot them downe; and if they persevered, if they
would not beate them out of their port. The Spanish
generall confessed his fault, pleaded ignorance not malice,
and submitted himselfe to the penaltie my father would
impose: but intreated, that their princes (through them)
might not come to have any jarre. My father a while
(as though offended), made himselfe hard to be intreated,
but in the end, all was shut up by his acknowledgement,
and the auncient amitie renewed, by feasting each other
aboord and ashore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As also in
her repassage.</div>

<p>The self same fleete, at their returne from Flaunders,
meeting with her majesties shippes in the Channell, though
sent to accompany the aforesaid queene, was constrained
during the time that they were with the English, to vayle
their flagges, and to acknowledge that which all must doe
that passe through the English seas.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> But to our voyage.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XI.</h3>

<p>Comming within the hayling of the hulke, wee demanded
whence shee was? Whether shee was bound? And what
her loading? Shee answered, that shee was of Denmarke,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
comming from Spaine, loaden with salt; we willed her to
strike her top-sayles, which shee did, and shewed us her
charter-parties, and billes of loading, and then saluted us,
as is the manner of the sea, and so departed.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XII.</h3>

<p>The next day the wind became southerly, and somewhat
too much, and my shipps being all deepe loaden, beganne
to feel the tempest, so that wee not able to lye by it,
neither a hull nor a try, and so with an easie sayle bare up
before the wind, with intent to put into Falmouth; but
God was pleased that comming within tenne leagues of
Sylly, the wind vered to the north-east, and so we went on
in our voyage.</p>

<p>Thwart of the Flees of Bayon,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> wee met with a small
ship of master Wattes, of London, called the <i>Elizabeth</i>,
which came out of Plimouth some eyght dayes after us;
of whom wee enformed ourselves of some particularities, and
wrote certaine letters to our friends, making relation of
what had past till that day, and so tooke our farewell each
of the other. The like we did with a small carvell<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> of
Plimouth, which wee mett in the height of the rocke
in Portingall.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>From thence wee directed our course to the ilands of
Madera; and about the end of June, in the sight of the
ilands, we descryed a sayle some three leagues to the east-wards,
and a league to windward of us, which by her
manner of working, and making, gave us to understand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
that shee was one of the kings frigatts; for shee was long
and snugg, and spread a large clewe, and standing to the
west-wards, and wee to the east-wards to recover her wake,
when we cast about, shee beganne to vere shete, and to
goe away lasking;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and within two glasses, it was plainely
seene that shee went from us, and so we followed on our
course, and shee seeing that, presently stroke her top-sayles,
which our pynace perceiving, and being within shot
continued the chase, till I shot off a peece and called her
away; which fault many runne into, thinking to get
thereby, and sometimes loose themselves by being too bold
to venture from their fleete; for it was impossible for us,
being too leeward, to take her, or to succour our owne,
shee being a ship of about two hundreth tunnes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dutie of
pynaces.</div>

<p>And pynaces to meddle with ships, is to buy repentance
at too deare a rate. For their office is, to wayte upon their
fleete, in calmes (with their oares) to follow a chase, and in
occasions to anchor neere the shore, when the greater
ships cannot, without perill; above all, to be readie and
obedient at every call. Yet will I not, that any wrest my
meaning; neither say I, that a pynace, or small ship
armed, may not take a great ship unarmed; for daily
experience teacheth us the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Madera
Ilands.</div>

<p>The Madera Ilands are two: the greater, called La
Madera, and the other, Porto Santo; of great fertilitie,
and rich in sugar, conserves, wine, and sweet wood, whereof
they take their name. Other commodities they yeeld, but
these are the principall. The chiefe towne and port is on
the souther side of the Madera, well fortified; they are
subject to the kingdome of Portingall; the inhabitants
and garrison all Portingalles.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Canarie
Ilands.</div>

<p>The third of July, we past along the Ilands of Canaria,
which have the name of a kingdome, and containe these
seaven ilands: Grand Canaria, Tenerifa, Palma, Gomera,
Lancerota, Forteventura, and Fierro. These ilands have
abundance of wine, sugar, conserves, orcall,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> pitch, iron,
and other commodities, and store of cattell, and corne, but
<span class="sidenote">Gorgosho.</span>
that a certaine worme, called <i>gorgosho</i>, breedeth in it,
which eateth out the substance, leaving the huske in
manner whole. The head iland, where the justice, which
they call <i>Audiencia</i>, is resident, and whither all sutes have
their appealation and finall sentence, is the grand Canaria,
although the Tenerifa is held for the better and richer
iland, and to have the best sugar; and the wine of the
Palma is reputed for the best. The pitch of these ilands
melteth not with the sunne, and therefore is proper for the
higher works of shipping. Betwixt Forteventura and
Lancerota is a goodly sound, fit for a meeting place for
any fleete; where is good anchoring and aboundance of
many sorts of fish. There is water to be had in most of
these ilands, but with great vigilance. For the naturalls
of them are venturous and hardie, and many times clime
up and downe the steepe rockes and broken hills, which
seeme impossible, which I would hardly have beleeved,
had I not seene it, and that with the greatest art and
agilitie that may be. Their armes, for the most part, are
launces of nine or ten foote, with a head of a foote and
halfe long, like unto boare-spears, save that the head is
somewhat more broad.</p>

<p>Two things are famous in these ilands, the Pike of
Tenerifa, which is the highest land in my judgement that
I have seene, and men of credit have told they have
<span class="sidenote">The description
of
Tenerifa.</span>
seene it more than fortie leagues off.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> It is like unto
a sugar loafe, and continually covered with snow, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
placed in the middest of a goodly vallie, most fertile, and
temperate round about it. Out of which, going up to the
Pike, the colde is so great, that it is insufferable, and going
downe to the townes of the iland, the heate seemeth most
extreame, till they approach neere the coast. The other
<span class="sidenote">Of a tree in
Fierro.</span>
is a tree in the iland of Fierro, which some write and
affirme, with the dropping of his leaves, to give water for
the sustenance of the whole iland, which I have not seene,
although I have beene on shoare on the iland;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> but those
which have seene it, have recounted this mysterie differently
to that which is written; in this manner: that this
tree is placed in the bottome of a valley, ever florishing
with broad leaves, and that round about it are a multitude
of goodly high pynes, which over-top it, and as it seemeth
were planted by the divine providence to preserve it from
sunne and wind. Out of this valley ordinarily rise every
day great vapours and exhalations, which by reason that
the sunne is hindered to worke his operation, with the
heighte of the mountaines towards the south-east, convert
themselves into moysture, and so bedewe all the trees of
the valley, and from those which over-top this tree, drops
down the dewe upon his leaves, and so from his leaves into
a round well of stone, which the naturalls of the land have
made to receive the water, of which the people and cattle
have great reliefe; but sometimes it raineth, and then the
inhabitants doe reserve water for many days to come, in
their cisternes and tynaxes,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> which is that they drinke of,
and wherewith they principally sustaine themselves.</p>

<p>The citty of the Grand Canaria, and chiefe port, is on
the west side of the iland; the head towne and port of
Tenerifa is towards the south part, and the port and towne
of the Palma and Gomera, on the east side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>In Gomera, some three leagues south-ward from the
towne, is a great river of water, but all these ilands are
perilous to land in, for the seege<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> caused by the ocean sea,
which always is forcible, and requireth great circumspection;
whosoever hath not urgent cause, is either to goe to
the east-wards, or the west-wards of all these ilands, as
well to avoyd the calmes, which hinder sometimes eight or
ten dayes sayling, as the contagion which their distemperature
is wont to cause, and with it to breed calenturas,
<span class="sidenote">The first
discoverers
of these
Ilands.</span>
which wee call burning fevers. These ilands are sayd to
be first discovered by a Frenchman, called John de Betancourt,
about the year 1405.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> They are now a kingdome

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XIII.</h3>

<p>Being cleare of the ilands, wee directed our course for
Cape Black,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and two howres before sunne set, we had sight
of a carvell some league in the winde of us, which seemed
to come from Gynea, or the ilands of Cape de Verde, and
for that hee, which had the sery-watch,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> neglected to look
out, being to lee-ward of the ilands, and so out of hope
of sight of any shipp, for the little trade and contrariety
of the winde, that though a man will, from few places hee
can recover the ilands. Comming from the south-wards,
wee had the winde of her, and perhaps the possession also,
<span class="sidenote">Note.</span>
whereof men of warre are to have particular care; for in
an houre and place unlookt for, many times chance accidents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
contrary to the ordinary course and custome; and to
have younkers in the top continually, is most convenient
and necessary, not onely for descrying of sayles and land,
but also for any sudden gust or occasion that may be
offered.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercises
upon the
southwards
of the
countries.</div>

<p>Seeing my selfe past hope of returning backe, without
some extraordinary accident, I beganne to set in order my
companie and victuals. And for that to the south-wards
of the Canaries is for the most part an idle navigation, I
devised to keepe my people occupied, as well to continue
them in health (for that too much ease in hott countries is
neither profitable nor healthfull), as also to divert them
from remembrance of their home, and from play, which
breedeth many inconveniences, and other bad thoughts
and workes which idleness is cause of;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and so shifting my
companie, as the custome is, into starboord and larboord
men, the halfe to watch and worke whilest the others slept
and take rest; I limited the three dayes of the weeke,
which appertayned to each, to be imploied in this manner;
the one for the use and clensing of their armes, the other
for roomeging, making of sayles, nettings, decking,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> and
defences for our shippes; and the third, for clensing their
bodies, mending and making their apparell, and necessaries,
which though it came to be practised but once in seaven
dayes, for that the Sabboth is ever to be reserved for God
alone, with the ordinary obligation which each person had
besides, was many times of force to be omitted. And thus
wee entertained our time with a fayre wind, and in few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
dayes had sight of the land of Barbary, some dozen
leagues to the northwards of Cape Blacke.</p>

<p>Before wee came to the Cape, wee tooke in our sayles,
and made preparation of hookes and lines to fish. For in
all that coast is great abundance of sundry kinds of fish,
but especially of porgus, which we call breames; many
Portingalls and Spaniards goe yearely thither to fish, as
our country-men to the New-found-land, and within Cape
Blacke have good harbour for reasonable shipping, where
they dry their fish, paying a certaine easie tribute to the
kings collector. In two houres wee tooke store of fish for
that day and the next, but longer it would not keepe
goode: and with this refreshing set sayle again, and
<span class="sidenote">Cape de Verd.</span>
directed our course betwixt the ilands of Cape de Verd
and the Maine. These ilands are held to be scituate in
one of the most unhealthiest climates of the world, and
therefore it is wisedome to shunne the sight of them, how
much more to make abode in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The unwholsomnesse
thereof.</div>

<p>In two times that I have beene in them, either cost us
the one halfe of our people, with fevers and fluxes of
sundry kinds; some shaking, some burning, some partaking
of both; some possesst with frensie, others with
sloath, and in one of them it cost me six moneths sicknesse,
with no small hazard of life; which I attribute to
the distemperature of the ayre, for being within fourteene
degrees of the equinoctiall lyne, the sunne hath great force
all the yeare, and the more for that often they passe, two,
three, and four yeares without rayne; and many times the
earth burneth in that manner as a man well shodd, cannot
endure to goe where the sunne shineth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heate.</div>

<p>With which extreame heate the bodie fatigated, greedily
desireth refreshing, and longeth the comming of the
<span class="sidenote">The breze.</span>
breze, which is the north-east winde, that seldome fayleth
in the after-noone at foure of the clocke, or sooner; which
comming cold and fresh, and finding the poores of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
body open, and (for the most part) naked, penetrateth the
very bones, and so causeth sudden distemperature, and
sundry manners of sicknesse, as the subjects are divers
whereupon they worke.</p>

<p>Departing out of the calmes of the ilands, and comming
into the fresh breeze, it causeth the like, and I have seene
within two dayes after that we have partaked of the fresh
ayre, of two thousand men, above a hundred and fiftie
have beene crazed in their health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The remedie.</div>

<p>The inhabitants of these ilands use a remedie for this,
which at my first being amongst them, seemed unto me
ridiculous; but since, time and experience hath taught to
be grounded upon reason. And is, that upon their heads
they weare a night-capp, upon it a montero,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> and a hat
over that, and on their bodies a sute of thicke cloth, and
upon it a gowne, furred or lyned with cotton, or bayes, to
defend them from the heate in that manner, as the inhabitants
of cold countries, to guard themselves from the
extreamitie of the colde. Which doubtlesse, is the best
diligence that any man can use, and whosoever prooveth it,
shall find himselfe lesse annoyed with the heate, then if
he were thinly cloathed, for that where the cold ayre
commeth, it peirceth not so subtilly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The influence
of the
moone in hot
countries.</div>

<p>The moone also in this climate, as in the coast of Guyne,
and in all hott countries, hath forcible operation in the
body of man; and therefore, as the plannet most prejudiciall
to his health, is to be shunned; as also not to
sleepe in the open ayre, or with any scuttle or window
open, whereby the one or the other may enter to hurt.</p>

<p>For a person of credit told me, that one night, in a
river of Guyne, leaving his window open in the side of his
cabin, the moone shining upon his shoulder, left him with
such an extraordinary paine and furious burning in it, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in above twentie houres, he was like to runne madde, but
in fine, with force of medicines and cures, after long torment,
he was eased.</p>

<p>Some I have heard say, and others write, that there is a
starre which never seperateth it self from the moone, but
a small distance; which is of all starres the most beneficiall
to man.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> For where this starre entreth with the moone, it
maketh voyde her hurtfull enfluence, and where not, it is
most perilous. Which, if it be so, is a notable secret of
the divine Providence, and a speciall cause amongst infinite
others, to move us to continuall thankesgiving; for that
he hath so extraordinarily compassed and fenced us from
infinite miseries, his most unworthie and ungratefull
creatures.</p>

<p>Of these ilands are two pyles:<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> the one of them lyeth
out of the way of trade, more westerly, and so little frequented;
the other lyeth some fourscore leagues from the
mayne, and containeth six in number, to wit: Saint Iago,
Fuego, Mayo, Bonavisto, Sal, and Bravo.</p>

<p>They are belonging to the kingdome of Portingall, and
inhabited by people of that nation, and are of great trade,
by reason of the neighbour-hood they have with Guyne
and Bynne;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> but the principall is the buying and selling
of negroes. They have store of sugar, salt, rice, cotton
wool, and cotton-cloth, amber-greece, cyvit, oliphants
teeth, brimstone, pummy stone, spunge, and some gold,
but little, and that from the mayne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saint Iago.</div>

<p>Saint Iago is the head iland, and hath one citie and two
townes, with their ports. The cittie called Saint Iago,
whereof the iland hath his name, hath a garrison, and two
fortes, scituated in the bottome of a pleasant valley, with a
running streame of water passing through the middest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
it, whether the rest of the ilands come for justice, being
the seat of the Audiencia, with his bishop.</p>

<p>The other townes are Playa, some three leagues to the
eastwards of Saint Iago, placed on high, with a goodly
bay, whereof it hath his name; and Saint Domingo, a
small towne within the land. They are on the souther
part of the iland, and have beene sacked sundry times in
anno 1582, by Manuel Serades, a Portingall, with a fleete
<span class="sidenote">Sacked by
Manuel Serades,
Sir
Francis
Drake, and
Sir Anthony
Shyrley.</span>
of French-men; in anno 1585, they were both burnt to
the ground by the English, Sir Francis Drake being
generall; and in anno 1596, Saint Iago was taken and
sacked by the English, Sir Anthony Shyrley being
generall.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fuego.</div>

<p>The second iland is Fuego; so called, for that day and
night there burneth in it a vulcan, whose flames in the
night are seene twentie leagues off in the sea. It is by
nature fortified in that sort, as but by one way is any accesse,
or entrance into it, and there cannot goe up above
two men a brest. The bread which they spend in these
ilands, is brought from Portingall and Spaine, saving that
which they make of rice, or of mayes, which wee call
Guynne-wheate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bravo.</div>

<p>The best watering is in the ile of Bravo, on the west
part of the iland, where is a great river, but foule anchoring,
as is in all these ilands, for the most part. The fruits
are few, but substantiall, as palmitos, plantanos, patatos,
and coco-nutts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palmito.</div>

<p>The palmito is like to the date tree, and as I thinke a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
kinde of it, but wilde. In all parts of Afrique and
America they are found, and in some parts of Europe, and
in divers parts different. In Afrique, and in the West
Indies they are small, that a man may cut them with a
knife, and the lesser the better: but in Brazill, they are
so great, that with difficultie a man can fell them with an
axe, and the greater the better; one foote within the top
is profitable, the rest is of no value; and that which is to
be eaten is the pith, which in some is better, in some
worse.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
plantane.</div>

<p>The plantane is a tree found in most parts of Afrique
and America, of which two leaves are sufficient to cover a
man from top to toe. It beareth fruit but once, and then
dryeth away, and out of his roote sprouteth up others, new.
In the top of the tree is his fruit, which groweth in a great
bunch, in the forme and fashion of puddings, in some
more, in some lesse. I have seene in one bunch above
foure hundred plantanes, which have weighed above fourescore
pound waight. They are of divers proportions, some
great, some lesser, some round, some square, some triangle,
most ordinarily of a spanne long, with a thicke skinne,
that peeleth easily from the meate; which is either white
or yellow, and very tender like butter, but no conserve is
better, nor of a more pleasing taste. For I never have
seene any man to whom they have bred mis-like, or done
hurt with eating much of them, as of other fruites.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>The best are those which ripen naturally on the tree, but
in most partes they cut them off in braunches, and hange
them up in their houses, and eate them as they ripe. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the birds and vermine presently in ripning on the tree, are
feeding on them. The best that I have seene are in Brasill,
<span class="sidenote">Placentia.</span>
in an iland called Placentia, which are small, and round,
and greene when they are ripe; whereas the others in
ripning become yellow. Those of the West Indies and
Guynne are great, and one of them sufficient to satisfie a
man; the onely fault they have is, that they are windie.
In some places they eate them in stead of bread, as in
Panama, and other parts of Tierra Firme. They grow and
prosper best when their rootes are ever covered with water;
they are excellent in conserve, and good sodden in different
manners, and dried on the tree, not inferior to suckett.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The cocos,
and their
kindes.</div>

<p>The coco nutt is a fruit of the fashion of a hassell nutt,
but that it is as bigge as an ordinary bowle, and some are
greater. It hath two shells, the uttermost framed (as it
were) of a multitude of threeds, one layd upon another,
with a greene skinne over-lapping them, which is soft and
thicke; the innermost is like to the shell of a hassell nutt
in all proportion, saving that it is greater and thicker, and
some more blacker. In the toppe of it is the forme of a
munkies face, with two eyes, his nose, and a mouth. It
containeth in it both meate and drinke; the meate white
as milke, and like to that of the kernell of a nutt, and as
good as almonds blancht, and of great quantitie: the water
is cleare, as of the fountaine, and pleasing in taste, and
somewhat answereth that of the water distilled of milke.
Some say it hath a singular propertie in nature for conserving
the smoothnesse of the skinne; and therefore in
Spaine and Portingall, the curious dames doe ordinarily
wash their faces and necks with it. If the holes of the
shell be kept close, they keepe foure or six moneths good,
and more; but if it be opened, and the water kept in the
shell, in few dayes it turneth to vineger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>They grow upon high trees, which have no boughes;
onely in the top they have a great cap of leaves, and under
them groweth the fruite upon certaine twigs. And some
affirme that they beare not fruite before they be above fortie
yeares old, they are in all things like to the palme trees,
and grow in many parts of Asia, Afrique, and America.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
The shels of these nuts are much esteemed for drinking
cups, and much cost and labour is bestowed upon them in
carving, graving, and garnishing them, with silver, gold,
and precious stones.</p>

<p>In the kingdome of Chile, and in Brasill, is another kinde
of these, which they call coquillos, (as wee may interpret,
little cocos) and are as big as wal-nuts; but round and
smooth, and grow in great clusters; the trees in forme are
all one, and the meate in the nut better, but they have no
water.</p>

<p>Another kinde of great cocos groweth in the Andes of
Peru, which have not the delicate meate nor drinke, which
the others have, but within are full of almonds, which are
placed as the graines in the pomegrannet, being three times
bigger then those of Europe, and are much like them in
tast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cyvet catts.</div>

<p>In these ilands are cyvet-cats, which are also found in
parts of Asia, and Afrique; esteemed for the civet they
yeelde, and carry about them in a cod in their hinder
parts, which is taken from them by force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monkeyes.</div>

<p>In them also are store of monkies, and the best proportioned
<span class="sidenote">Parrots.</span>
that I have seene; and parrots, but of colour
different to those of the West Indies; for they are of a
russet or gray colour, and great speakers.

<h3>SECTION XIV.</h3>

<p>With a faire and large winde we continued our course, till
we came within five degrees of the equinoctiall lyne, where
the winde tooke us contrary by the south-west, about the
twentie of Julie, but a fayre gale of wind and a smooth
sea, so that wee might beare all a taunt:<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and to advantage
ourselves what wee might, wee stoode to the east-wards,
being able to lye south-east and by south. The next day
about nine of the clocke, my companie being gathered
together to serve God, which wee accustomed to doe every
morning and evening, it seemed unto me that the coulour
of the sea was different to that of the daies past, and which
is ordinarily where is deepe water; and so calling the
captaine, and master of my ship, I told them that to my
seeming the water was become very whitish, and that it
made shewe of sholde water. Whereunto they made
answere, that all the lynes in our shippes could not fetch
ground: for wee could not be lesse then threescore and
tenne leagues off the coast, which all that kept reckoning
in the ship agreed upon, and my selfe was of the same
opinion. And so wee applyed ourselves to serve God, but
all the time that the service endured, my heart could not
be at rest, and still me thought the water beganne to waxe
whiter and whiter. Our prayers ended, I commanded a
lead and a lyne to be brought, and heaving the lead in
fourteene fathoms, wee had ground, which put us all into
a maze, and sending men into the toppe, presently discovered
the land of Guynne, some five leagues from us,
very low land. I commanded a peece to be shott, and lay
by the lee, till my other shippes came up. Which hayling
us, wee demanded of them how farre they found themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
off the land; who answered, some threescore and
tenne, or fourescore leagues: when wee told them wee
had sounded and found but foureteene fathomes, and that
we were in sight of land, they began to wonder. But
having consulted what was best to be done, I caused
my shalop to be manned, which I towed at the sterne of
my ship continually, and sent her and my pynace a head to
sound, and followed them with an easie sayle, till we came
in seaven and six fathome water, and some two leagues
from the shore anchored, in hope by the sea, or by the
land to find some refreshing. The sea we found to be
barren of fish, and my boates could not discover any landing
place, though a whole day they had rowed alongst the
coast, with great desire to set foote on shore, for that the
sedge was exceeding great and dangerous. Which experienced,
wee set sayle, notwithstanding the contrarietie
of the winde, sometimes standing to the west-wards, sometime
to the east-wards, according to the shifting of the
wind.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Note.</div>

<p>Here is to be noted, that the error which we fell into in
our accompts, was such as all men fall into where are currants
that set east or west, and are not knowne; for that
there is no certaine rule yet practised for triall of the
longitude, as there is of the latitude, though some curious
and experimented of our nation, with whom I have had
conference about this poynt, have shewed me two or three
manner of wayes how to know it.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The losse of
the <i>Edward
Cotton</i>.</div>

<p>This, some years before, was the losse of the <i>Edward
Cotton</i>, bound for the coast of Brasill, which taken with
the winde contrary neere the lyne, standing to the east-wards,
and making accompt to be fiftie or sixtie leagues off
the coast, with all her sayles standing, came suddenly a
ground upon the sholes of Madre-bomba, and so was cast
away, though the most part of their company saved themselves
upon raffes; but with the contagion of the countrie,
and bad entreatie which the negros gave them, they died;
so that there returned not to their country above three or
foure of them.</p>

<p>But God Almightie dealt more mercifully with us, in
shewing us our error in the day, and in time that wee
might remedie it; to him be evermore glory for all.</p>

<p>This currant from the line equinoctiall, to twentie degrees
northerly, hath great force, and setteth next of any
thing east, directly upon the shore; which we found by this
meanes: standing to the westwards, the wind southerly,
when we lay with our ships head west, and by south, we
gayned in our heith<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> more then if wee had made our way
good west south-west; for that, the currant tooke us under
the bow; but lying west, or west and by north, we lost
more in twelve houres then the other way we could get in
foure and twentie. By which plainly we saw, that the
currant did set east next of any thing. Whether this
currant runneth ever one way, or doth alter, and how, we
could by no meanes understand, but tract of time and observation
will discover this, as it hath done of many others
in sundry seas.</p>

<p>The currant that setteth betwixt New-found-land and
Spaine, runneth also east and west, and long time deceived
many, and made some to count the way longer, and others
shorter, according as the passage was speedie or slowe; not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
knowing that the furtherance or hinderance of the currant
was cause of the speeding or flowing of the way. And in
sea cardes I have seene difference of above thirtie leagues
betwixt the iland Tercera, and the mayne. And others
have recounted unto me, that comming from the India’s,
and looking out for the ilands of Azores, they have had
sight of Spaine. And some have looked out for Spaine,
and have discovered the ilands.</p>

<p>The selfe same currant is in the Levant sea, but runneth
trade betwixt the maynes, and changeable sometimes to
the east-wards, sometimes to the west-wards.</p>

<p>In Brasill and the South sea, the currant likewise is
changeable, but it runneth ever alongst the coast, accompanying
the winde: and it is an infallible rule, that
twelve or twentie foure houres before the winde alters, the
currant begins to change.</p>

<p>In the West Indies onely the currant runneth continually
one way, and setteth alongst the coast from the
equinoctiall lyne towards the north. No man hath yet
found that these courrants keepe any certaine time, or run
so many dayes, or moneths, one way as another, as doth
the course of ebbing and flowing, well knowne in all seas;
only neere the shore they have small force; partly, because
of the reflux which the coast causeth, and partly for the ebbing
and flowing, which more or lesse is generall in most seas.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>When the currant runneth north or south, it is easily
discovered by augmenting or diminishing the height; but
how to know the setting of the currant from east to west
in the mayne sea, is difficult; and as yet I have not knowne
any man, or read any authour, that hath prescribed any
certaine meane or way to discover it.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> But experience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
teacheth that in the mayne sea, for the most part, it is variable;
and therefore the best and safest rule to prevent the
danger (which the uncertainty and ignorance heereof may
cause), is carefull and continuall watch by day and night,
and upon the east and west course ever to bee before the
shipp, and to use the meanes possible to know the errour,
by the rules which newe authours may teach; beating off
and on, somtimes to the west-wards, sometimes to the east-wards,
with a fayre gale of winde.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XVI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The scurvey.</div>

<p>Being betwixt three or foure degrees of the equinoctiall
line, my company within a fewe dayes began to fall sicke,
of a disease which sea-men are wont to call the scurvey:
and seemeth to bee a kind of dropsie, and raigneth most
in this climate of any that I have heard or read of in the
world; though in all seas it is wont to helpe and increase
the miserie of man; it possesseth all those of which it
taketh hold, with a loathsome sloathfulnesse, even to eate:
they would be content to change their sleepe and rest,
which is the most pernicious enemie in this sicknesse, that
is knowne. It bringeth with it a great desire to drinke,
and causeth a generall swelling of all parts of the body,
especially of the legs and gums, and many times the teeth
fall out of the jawes without paine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signes.</div>

<p>The signes to know this disease in the beginning are
divers: by the swelling of the gummes, by denting of the
flesh of the leggs with a man’s finger, the pit remayning
without filling up in a good space. Others show it with
their lasinesse: others complaine of the cricke of the backe,
etc., all which are, for the most part, certaine tokens of
infection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause.</div>

<p>The cause of this sicknes some attribute to sloath; some
to conceite; and divers men speake diversly: that which
I have observed is, that our nation is more subject unto it
then any other; because being bred in a temperate clymate,
where the naturall heate restrayned, giveth strength to the
stomacke, sustayning it with meates of good nourishment,
and that in a wholesome ayre; whereas comming into the
hot countries (where that naturall heate is dispersed through
the whole body, which was wont to be proper to the stomache;
and the meates for the most part preserved with
salt, and its substance thereby diminished, and many times
corrupted), greater force for digestion is now required then
in times past; but the stomache finding less virtue to doe
his office, in reparting to each member his due proportion
in perfection, which either giveth it rawe, or remayneth
with it indigested by his hardnes or cruditie, infeebleth the
body, and maketh it unlusty and unfit for any thing; for
the stomache being strong (though all parts els be weake),
there is ever a desire to feede, and aptnes to perform whatsoever
can be required of a man; but though all other
members be strong and sound, if the stomache be opprest,
or squemish, all the body is unlustie, and unfit for any
thing, and yeeldeth to nothing so readily as sloathfulnes,
which is confirmed by the common answere to all questions:
as, will you eate? will you sleepe? will you walke?
will you play? The answere is, I have no stomache:
which is as much as to say, no, not willingly: thereby confirming,
that without a sound and whole stomache, nothing
can bee well accomplished, nor any sustenance well digested.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seething of
meat in salt
water.</div>

<p>The seething of the meate in salt water, helpeth to cause
this infirmitie, which in long voyages can hardly be avoyded:
but if it may be, it is to be shunned; for the water of the
<span class="sidenote">Corruption
of victuall.</span>
sea to man’s body is very unwholesome. The corruption
of the victuals, and especially of the bread, is very pernicious;
<span class="sidenote">Vapours of
the sea.</span>
the vapours and ayre of the sea also is nothing
profitable, especially in these hot countries, where are many
calmes. And were it not for the moving of the sea by the
force of windes, tydes, and currants, it would corrupt all the
world.</p>

<p>The experience I saw in anno 1590, lying with a fleete
<span class="sidenote">Azores.</span>
of her majesties ships about the ilands of the Azores,
almost six moneths; the greatest part of the time we were
becalmed: with which all the sea became so replenished
with several sorts of gellyes, and formes of serpents, adders,
and snakes, as seemed wonderfull: some greene, some
blacke, some yellow, some white, some of divers coulours;
and many of them had life, and some there were a yard
and halfe, and two yards long; which had I not seene, I
could hardly have beleeved. And hereof are witnesses all
the companies of the ships which were then present; so
that hardly a man could draw a buckett of water cleere of
some corruption.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> In which voyage, towards the end
thereof, many of every ship (saving of the <i>Nonpereil</i>, which
was under my charge, and had onely one man sicke in all
the voyage), fell sicke of this disease, and began to die
apace, but that the speedie passage into our country was
<span class="sidenote">The
remedies.</span>
remedie to the crazed, and a preservative for those that were
not touched. The best prevention for this disease (in my
judgement) is to keepe cleane the shippe; to besprinkle her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
ordinarily with vineger, or to burne tarre, and some sweet
savours; to feed upon as few salt meats in the hot country as
<span class="sidenote">By dyet.</span>
may be; and especially to shunne all kindes of salt fish, and
to reserve them for the cold climates; and not to dresse
any meate with salt water, nor to suffer the companie to
wash their shirts nor cloathes in it, nor to sleepe in their
cloaths when they are wett. For this cause it is necessarily
required, that provision be made of apparell for the company,
<span class="sidenote">By shift.</span>
that they may have wherewith to shift themselves;
being a common calamitie amongst the ordinary sort of
mariners, to spend their thrift on the shore, and to bring
to sea no more cloaths then they have backes. For the
bodie of man is not refreshed with any thing more then
with shifting cleane cloaths; a great preservative of health
in hott countries.</p>

<p>The second antidote is, to keepe the companie occupied
<span class="sidenote">By labour.</span>
in some bodily exercise of worke, of agilitie, of pastimes, of
dauncing, of use of armes; these helpeth much to banish
<span class="sidenote">By early
eating and
drinking.</span>
this infirmitie. Thirdly, in the morning, at discharge of
the watch, to give every man a bit of bread, and a draught
of drinke, either beere or wine mingled with water (at the
least, the one halfe), or a quantitie mingled with beere, that
the pores of the bodie may be full, when the vapours of the
sea ascend up.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>The morning draught should be ever of the best and
choysest of that in the ship. Pure wine I hold to be more
hurtfull then the other is profitable. In this, others will
be of a contrary opinion, but I thinke partiall. If not,
then leave I the remedies thereof to those physitions and
surgeons who have experience; and I wish that some
learned man would write of it, for it is the plague of the
sea, and the spoyle of mariners. Doubtlesse, it would be a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
meritorious worke with God and man, and most beneficiall
for our countrie; for in twentie yeares, since that I have
used the sea, I dare take upon me to give accompt of ten
thousand men consumed with this disease.</p>

<p>That which I have seene most fruitfull for this sicknesse,

<h3>SECTION XVII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The company
sicke
and dismayed.</div>

<p>Having stood to the westwards some hundreth leagues and
more, and the wind continuing with us contrarie, and the
sicknesse so fervent, that every day there dyed more or
lesse,&mdash;my companie in generall began to dismay, and to
desire to returne homewards, which I laboured to hinder
by good reasons and perswasions; as that to the West
Indies we had not above eight hundreth leagues, to the
ilands of Azores little lesse, and before we came to the
ilands of Cape de Verde, that we should meete with the
breze; for every night we might see the reach goe contrary
to the winde which wee sayled by; verifying the old
proverbe amongst mariners,&mdash;that he hath need of a long
mast, that will sayle by the reach: and that the neerest
land and speediest refreshing we could look for, was the
coast of Brasill; and that standing towards it with the wind
we had, we shortned our way for the Indies; and that to put
all the sicke men together in one shippe, and to send her
home, was to make her their grave. For we could spare
but few sound men, who were also subject to fall sicke,
and the misery, notwithstanding, remedilesse. With which
they were convinced, and remayned satisfied. So leaving
all to their choyse, with the consideration of what I perswaded,
they resolved, with me, to continue our course, till
that God was pleased to looke upon us with his Fatherly
eyes of mercie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brasill.</div>

<p>As we approached neerer and neerer the coast of Brasill,
the wind began to vere to the east-wardes; and about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
<span class="sidenote">Cape S.
Augustine.</span>
middle of October, to be large and good for us; and about
the 18th of October, we were thwart of Cape Saint Augustine,
which lyeth in sixe degrees to the southwards of the
<span class="sidenote">Farnambuca.</span>
lyne; and the twenty-one in the height of Farnambuca,
but some fourscore leagues from the coast; the twentie
foure in the height of Bayea de Todos Santos; neere the
end of October, betwixt seventeen and eighteen degrees,
we were in sixteen fathomes, sounding of the great sholes,
which lye alongst the coast, betwixt the bay of Todos
<span class="sidenote">Todos
Santos.
Pura de
Vitoria.</span>
Santos, and the port of Santos, alias Pura Senora de Vitoria;
which are very perilous.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>But the divine Providence hath ordayned great flockes
of small birds, like snytes,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> to live upon the rockes and
broken lands of these sholes, and are met with ordinarily
twentie leagues before a man come in danger of them.</p>

<p>It shall not be amisse here to recount the accidents
which befell us during this contrary winde, and the
curiosities to be observed in all this time. Day and night
we had continually a fayre gale of winde, and a smooth
sea, without any alteration; one day, the carpenters having
<span class="sidenote">Dangers of
fire.</span>
calked the decke of our shippe, which the sunne with his
extreame heate had opened, craved licence to heate a little
pitch in the cook-roome; which I would not consent unto
<span class="sidenote">By heating
of pitch.</span>
by any meanes; for that my cooke-roomes were under the
decke, knowing the danger; until the master undertooke
that no danger should come thereof. But he recommended
the charge to another, who had a better name then experience.
He suffered the pitch to rise, and to runne into
the fire, which caused so furious a flame as amazed him,
and forced all to flie his heate. One of my company, with
a double payre of gloves, tooke off the pitch-pot, but the
fire forced him to let slip his hold-fast, before he could set
it on the hearth, and so overturned it, and as the pitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
began to runne, so the fire to enlarge it selfe, that in a
moment a great part of the shippe was on a light fire. I
being in my cabin, presently imagined what the matter
was, and for all the hast I could make, before I came the
fire was above the decke: for remedie whereof, I commanded
all my companie to cast their rugge-gownes into
the sea, with ropes fastened unto them. These I had provided
for my people to watch in; for in many hott countries
the nights are fresh and colde; and devided one gowne to
two men, a starboord and a larboord man; so that he which
watched had ever the gowne: for they which watched not,
were either in their cabins, or under the decke, and so
needed them not. The gownes being well soked, every
man that could, tooke one, and assaulted the fire; and although
some were singed, others scalded, and many burned,
God was pleased that the fire was quenched, which I thought
impossible; and doubtlesse, I never saw my selfe in greater
perill in all the dayes of my life. Let all men take example
by us, not to suffer, in any case, pitch to be heate in the
ship, except it be with a shotte heate in the fire, which
cannot breed daunger; nor to permit fire to be kindled,
but upon meere necessitie; for the inconvenience thereof
is for the most part remedilesse.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">By taking
tobacco.</div>

<p>With drinking of tobacco it is said, that the <i>Roebucke</i>
was burned in the range of Dartmouth.</p>

<p>The <i>Primrose</i>, of London, was fired with a candle, at
Tilbery-hope, and nothing saved but her kele.</p>

<p>And another ship bound for Barbary, at Wapping.</p>

<p>The <i>Jesus of Lubecke</i> had her gunner-roome set on fire
with a match, and had beene burnt without redemption, if
that my father, Sir John Hawkins, knight, then generall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>

and scutling

in her, had not commaunded her sloppers<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> to be stopt, and
the men to come to the pumpes, wherof shee had two which
went with chaynes; and plying them, in a moment there
was three or foure inches of water upon the decke, which
with scoopes, swabbles,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> and platters, they threw upon the
fire, and so quenched it, and delivered both ship and
men out of no small danger.</p>

<p>Great care is to be had also in cleaving of wood, in
hooping or scuttling<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> of caske, and in any businesse where
violence is to be used with instruments of iron, steele, or
stone: and especially in opening of powder, these are not
to be used, but mallets of wood; for many mischances
happen beyond all expectation.</p>

<p>I have beene credibly enformed by divers persons, that
comming out of the Indies, with scuttling a butt of water,
the water hath taken fire, and flamed up, and put all in
hazard. And a servant of mine, Thomas Gray, told me,
that in the shippe wherein he came out of the Indies, anno
1600, there happened the like; and that if with mantles
they had not smothered the fire, they had bin all burned
with a pipe of water, which in scutling tooke fire.</p>

<p>Master John Hazlelocke reported, that in the arsenall
of Venice happened the like, he being present. For mine
<span class="sidenote">By nature of
waters.</span>
own part, I am of opinion, that some waters have this
propertie, and especially such as have their passage by
mines of brimstone, or other mineralls, which, as all men
know, give extraordinary properties unto the waters by
which they runne. Or it may be that the water being in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
wine caske, and kept close, may retayne an extraordinary
propertie of the wine.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Yea, I have drunke fountaine and
river waters many times, which have had a savour as that
of brimstone.</p>

<p>Three leagues from Bayon, in France, I have proved of
a fountaine that hath this savour, and is medicinable for
many diseases. In the South sea, in a river some five
leagues from Cape Saint Francisco, in one degree and a
halfe to the northwardes of the lyne, in the bay of Atacames,
is a river of fresh water, which hath the like savour.
Of this I shall have occasion to speake in another place,
treating of the divers properties of fountaines and rivers;
and therefore to our purpose.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XVIII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">By swearing.</div>

<p>We had no small cause to give God thankes and prayse for
our deliverance; and so, all our ships once come together,
wee magnified his glorious Name for his mercie towards
us, and tooke an occasion hereby to banish swearing out
of our shippes, which amongst the common sort of mariners
and sea-faring men, is too ordinarily abused. So with a
generall consent of all our companie, it was ordayned that
in every ship there should be a palmer or ferula, which
should be in the keeping of him who was taken with an
oath; and that he who had the palmer should give to every
other that he tooke swearing, in the palme of the hand, a
palmada with it, and the ferula. And whosoever at the
time of evening, or morning prayer, was found to have the
palmer, should have three blowes given him by the captaine
or master; and that he should be still bound to free himselfe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
by taking another, or else to runne in daunger of
continuing the penaltie: which executed, few dayes reformed
the vice; so that in three dayes together, was not
one oath heard to be sworne. This brought both ferulas
and swearing out of use.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>And certainly, in vices, custome is the principall sustenance;
and for their reformation, it little availeth to give
good counsell, or to make good lawes and ordenances except
they be executed.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XIX.</h3>

<p>In this time of contrary wind, those of my company
which were in health, recreated themselves with fishing,
and beholding the hunting and hawking of the sea, and
the battell betwixt the whale and his enemies, which truly
are of no small pleasure. And therefore for the curious,
I will spend some time in declaration of them.</p>

<p>Ordinarily such ships as navigate betweene the tropiques,
are accompanied with three sorts of fish: the dolphin,
which the Spaniards call <i>dozado</i>; the <i>bonito</i>, or Spanish
makerell; and the sharke, alias <i>tiberune</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dolphin.</div>

<p>The dolphin I hold to be one of the swiftest fishes in the
sea. He is like unto a breame, but that he is longer and
thinner, and his scales very small. He is of the colour
of the rayn-bow, and his head different to other fishes;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
for, from his mouth halfe a spanne, it goeth straight upright,
as the head of a wherry, or the cut-water of a ship.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
He is very good meate if he be in season, but the best part
of him is his head, which is great. They are some bigger,
some lesser; the greatest that I have seene, might be some
foure foote long.</p>

<p>I hold it not without some ground, that the auncient
philosophers write, that they be enamoured of a man; for
in meeting with shipping, they accompany them till they
approach to colde climates; this I have noted divers times.
For disembarking out of the West Indies, anno 1583,
within three or foure dayes after, we mett a scole<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of them,
which left us not till we came to the ilands of Azores, nere
a thousand leagues. At other times I have noted the like.</p>

<p>But some may say, that in the sea are many scoles<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> of
this kinde of fish, and how can a man know if they were
the same?</p>

<p>Who may be thus satisfied, that every day in the morning,
which is the time that they approach neerest the ship, we
should see foure, five, and more, which had, as it were,
our eare-marke; one hurt upon the backe, another neere
the tayle, another about the fynnes; which is a sufficient
proofe that they were the same; for if those which had
received so bad entertainment of us would not forsake us,
much less those which we had not hurt. Yet that which
makes them most in love with ships and men, are the
scrappes and refreshing they gather from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bonito.</div>

<p>The bonito, or Spanish makerell, is altogether like unto
a makerell, but that it is somewhat more growne; he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
reasonable foode, but dryer then a makerell. Of them there
are two sorts: the one is this which I have described; the
other, so great as hardly one man can lift him. At such
times as wee have taken of these, one sufficed for a meale
for all my company. These, from the fynne of the tayle
forwards, have upon the chyne seven small yellow hillocks,
close one to another.</p>

<p>The dolphins and bonitos are taken with certaine instruments
of iron which we call vysgeis,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> in forme of an eel
speare, but that the blades are round, and the poynts like
unto the head of a broad arrow: these are fastened to
long staves of ten or twelve foote long, with lynes tied unto
them, and so shott to the fish from the beake-head, the
poope, or other parts of the shippe, as occasion is ministered.
They are also caught with hookes and lynes, the hooke
being bayted with a redd cloth, or with a white cloth made
into the forme of a fish, and sowed upon the hooke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sharke.</div>

<p>The shark, or tiberune, is a fish like unto those which wee
call dogge-fishes, but that he is farre greater. I have seene of
them eight or nine foote long; his head is flatt and broad,
and his mouth in the middle, underneath, as that of the
scate; and he cannot byte of the bayte before him, but by
making a halfe turne; and then he helpeth himselfe with
his tayle, which serveth him in stead of a rudder. His
skinne is rough (like to the fish which we call a rough
hound), and russet, with reddish spottes, saving that under
the belly he is all white: he is much hated of sea-faring
men, who have a certaine foolish superstition with them,
and say, that the ship hath seldome good successe, that is
much accompanied with them.</p>

<p>It is the most ravenous fish knowne in the sea; for he
swalloweth all that he findeth. In the puch<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> of them hath
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
beene found hatts, cappes, shooes, shirts, leggs and armes
of men, ends of ropes, and many other things; whatsoever
is hanged by the shippes side, hee sheereth it, as though
it were with a razor; for he hath three rowes of teeth on
either side, as sharpe as nailes; some say they are good for
pick-tooths. It hath chanced that a yonker casting himselfe
into the sea to swimme, hath had his legge bitten off
above the knee by one of them. And I have beene enformed,
that in the <i>Tyger</i>, when Sir Richard Greenfield
went to people Virginia, a sharke cut off the legge of one
of the companie, sitting in the chaines and washing himselfe.
They spawne not as the greatest part of fishes doe,
but whelpe, as the dogge or wolfe; and for many dayes
after that shee hath whelped, every night, and towards any
storme, or any danger which may threaten them hurt, the
damme receiveth her whelpes in at her mouth, and preserveth
them, till they be able to shift for themselves. I
have seene them goe in and out, being more then a foote
and halfe long; and after taking the damme, we have
found her young ones in her belly.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Every day my company tooke more or lesse of them, not
for that they did eat of them (for they are not held wholesome;
although the Spaniards, as I have seene, doe eate
them), but to recreate themselves, and in revenge of the
injuries received by them; for they live long, and suffer
much after they bee taken, before they dye.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>At the tayle of one they tyed a great logge of wood, at
another, an empty batizia,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> well stopped; one they yoaked
like a hogge; from another, they plucked out his eyes, and
so threw them into the sea. In catching two together,
they bound them tayle to tayle, and so set them swimming;
another with his belly slit, and his bowels hanging out,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
which his fellowes would have every one a snatch at; with
other infinite inventions to entertayne the time, and to
avenge themselves; for that they deprived them of swimming,
and fed on their flesh being dead. They are taken
with harping irons, and with great hookes made of purpose,
with swyvels and chaines; for no lyne nor small rope
can hold them, which they share not asunder.</p>

<p>There doth accompany this fish divers little fishes, which
are callet pilats fishes, and are ever upon his fynnes, his
head, or his backe, and feede of the scraps and superfluities
of his prayes. They are in forme of a trought, and streked
like a makerell, but that the strekes are white and blacke,
and the blacke greater then the white.</p>

<p>The manner of hunting and hawking representeth that
which we reasonable creatures use, saving onely in the
disposing of the game. For by our industry and abilitie
the hound and hawke is brought to that obedience, that
whatsoever they seize is for their master; but here it is
otherwise: for the game is for him that seizeth it. The
dolphins and bonitoes are the houndes, and the alcatraces
<span class="sidenote">Flying fishes</span>
the hawkes, and the flying fishes the game; whose wonderfull
making magnifieth the Creator, who for their safetie
and helpe, hath given them extraordinary manner of
fynnes, which serve in stead of wings, like those of the
batt or rere-mouse; of such a delicate skinne, interlaced
with small bones so curiously, as may well cause admiration
in the beholders. They are like unto pilchards in
colour, and making; saving that they are somewhat
rounder, and (for the most part) bigger. They flie best
with a side wind, but longer then their wings be wett they
cannot sustaine the waight of their bodies; and so the
greatest flight that I have seene them make, hath not
beene above a quarter of a myle. They commonly goe in
scoles, and serve for food for the greater fishes, or for the
foules. The dolphins and bonitoes doe continually hunt
after them, and the alcatraces lye soaring in the ayre, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
see when they spring, or take their flight; and ordinarily,
he that escapeth the mouth of the dolphin or bonito, helping
himselfe by his wings, falleth prisoner into the hands
of the alcatrace, and helpeth to fill his gorge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alcatrace.</div>

<p>The alcatrace<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> is a sea-fowle, different to all that I have
seene, either on the land or in the sea. His head like unto
the head of a gull, but his bill like unto a snytes bill,
somewhat shorter, and in all places alike. He is almost
like to a heronshaw; his leggs a good spanne long, his
wings very long, and sharpe towards the poynts, with a
long tayle like to a pheasant, but with three or foure
feathers onely, and these narrower. He is all blacke, of
the colour of a crow, and of little flesh; for he is almost
all skinne and bones. He soareth the highest of any fowle
that I have seene, and I have not heard of any, that have
seene them rest in the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fight of
the whale,</div>

<p>Now of the fight betwixt the whale and his contraries;
which are the sword-fish and the thresher. The whale is
of the greatest fishes in the sea; and to count but the
truth, unlesse dayly experience did witnesse the relation,
it might seeme incredible; hee is a huge unwildlie fish, and
to those which have not seene of them, it might seeme
strange, that other fishes should master him; but certaine
it is, that many times the thresher and sword-fish, meeting
him joyntly, doe make an end of him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">with the
sword fish</div>

<p>The sword fish<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> is not great, but strongly made; and in
the top of his chine, as a man may say, betwixt the necke
and shoulders, he hath a manner of sword in substance,
like unto a bone, of foure or five inches broad, and above
three foote long, full of prickles of either side: it is but thin,
for the greatest that I have seene, hath not beene above a
finger thicke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">and thresher.</div>

<p>The thresher is a greater fish, whose tayle is very broad
and thicke, and very waightie. They fight in this maner;
the sword fish placeth himselfe under the belly of the
whale, and the thresher upon the ryme<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> of the water, and
with his tayle thresheth upon the head of the whale, till
hee force him to give way; which the sword fish perceiving,
receiveth him upon his sword, and wounding him in the
belly forceth him to mount up againe (besides that he
cannot abide long under water, but must of force rise upp
to breath): and when in such manner they torment him,
that the fight is sometimes heard above three leagues distance,
and I dare affirme, that I have heard the blowes of
the thresher two leagues off, as the report of a peece of
ordinance; the whales roaring being heard much farther.
It also happeneth sundry times that a great part of the
water of the sea round about them, with the blood of the
whale, changeth his colour. The best remedy the whale
hath in this extremitie to helpe himselfe, is to get him to
land, which hee procureth as soone as hee discovereth his
adversaries; and getting the shore, there can fight but one
with him, and for either of them, hand to hand, he is too
good.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The whale is a fish not good to be eaten, hee is
almost all fat,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> but esteemed for his trayne; and many goe
to the New-found-land, Greene-land, and other parts onely
to fish for them; which is in this maner: when they which
seeke the whale discover him, they compasse him round
<span class="sidenote">The taking
of the whale.</span>
about with pynaces or shalops. In the head of every boat
is placed a man, with a harping iron, and a long lyne, the
one end of it fastned to the harping iron, and the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
end to the head of the boat, in which it lyeth finely coiled;
and for that he cannot keepe long under water, he sheweth
which way he goeth, when rising neere any of the boats,
within reach, he that is neerest, darteth his harping iron
at him. The whale finding himself to be wounded, swimmeth
to the bottome, and draweth the pynace after him;
which the fisher-men presently forsake, casting themselves
into the sea; for that many times he draweth the boat
under water: those that are next, procure to take them
up. For this cause all such as goe for that kind of fishing,
are experimented in swimming. When one harping iron
is fastned in the whale, it is easily discerned which way he
directeth his course: and so ere long they fasten another,
and another in him. When he hath three or foure boats
dragging after him, with their waight, his bleeding, and
fury, he becommeth so over-mastred, that the rest of the
pynaces with their presence and terror, drive him to the
place where they would have him, nature instigating him
to covet the shore.</p>

<p>Being once hurt, there is little need to force him to land.
Once on the shore, they presently cut great peeces of him,
and in great cauldrons seeth them.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> The uppermost in the
cauldrons is the fatt, which they skimme off, and put it
into hogsheads and pipes. This is that they call whales
oyle, or traine oyle, accompted the best sort of traine oyle.
It is hard to be beleeved, what quantitie is gathered of one
whale; of the tongue, I have beene enformed, have many
pipes beene filled. The fynnes are also esteemed for many
and sundry uses; as is his spawne for divers purposes: this
wee corruptly call <i>parmacittie</i>; of the Latine word, <i>spermaceti</i>.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>

<div class="sidenote">Amber-greece.</div>

<p>And the precious amber-greece some thinke also to be
found in his bowells, or voyded by him: but not in all
seas: yea, they maintaine for certaine, that the same is
ingendred by eating an hearbe which groweth in the sea.
This hearbe is not in all seas, say they, and therefore,
where it wanteth, the whales give not this fruit. In the
coast of the East Indies in many partes is great quantitie.
In the coastes of Guyne, of Barbary, of the Florida, in the
islands of Cape de Verde, and the Canaries, amber-greece
hath beene many times found, and sometimes on the coast
of Spaine and England. Whereupon it is presumed, that
all these seas have not the hearbe growing in them. The
cause why the whale should eate this hearbe, I have not
heard, nor read. It may be surmised, that it is as that of
the becunia, and other beasts, which breed the beazer
stone;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> who feeding in the valleyes and mountaines, where
are many venemous serpents, and hearbes; when they find
themselves touched with any poyson, forthwith they runne
for remedie to an hearbe, which the Spaniards call <i>contrayerva</i>,
that is to say, contrary to poyson: which having
eaten, they are presently cured: but the substance of the
hearbe converteth it selfe into a medicinable stone; so it
may be, that the whale feeding of many sortes of fishes,
and some of them, as is knowne, venemous, when he
findeth himselfe touched, with this hearbe he cureth himselfe;
and not being able to digest it, nature converteth
it into this substance, provoketh it out, or dyeth with it in
his belly; and being light, the sea bringeth it to the coast.</p>

<p>All these are imaginations, yet instruments to moove us
to the glorifying of the great and universal Creatour of all,
whose secret wisedome, and wonderfull workes, are incomprehensible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Amber-greece.</div>

<p>But the more approved generation of the amber-greece,
and which carrieth likliest probabilitie is, that it is a liquor
which issueth out of certaine fountaines, in sundry seas,
and being of a light and thicke substance, participating of
the ayre, suddenly becommeth hard, as the yellow amber,
of which they make beads;<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> which is also a liquor of a
fountayne in the Germayne sea. In the bottome it is soft
and white, and partaking of the ayre becommeth hard and
stonie: also the corrall in the sea is soft, but comming into
the ayre, becommeth a stone.</p>

<p>Those who are of this former opinion, thinke the reason
why the amber greece is sometimes found in the whale,
to be, for that he swalloweth it, as other things which he
findeth swimming upon the water; and not able to digest
it, it remaineth with him till his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">By the
Indians.</div>

<p>Another manner of fishing and catching the whale I
cannot omit, used by the Indians, in Florida; worthy to
be considered, in as much as the barbarous people have
found out so great a secret, by the industry and diligence
of one man, to kill so great and huge a monster: it is in
this manner.</p>

<p>The Indian discovering a whale, procureth two round
billets of wood, sharpneth both at one end, and so binding
them together with a cord, casteth himselfe with them into
the sea, and swimmeth towards the whale: if he come to
him, the whale escapeth not; for he placeth himselfe upon
his necke, and although the whale goeth to the bottome,
he must of force rise presently to breath (for which nature
hath given him two great holes in the toppe of his head,
by which, every time that he breatheth, he spouteth out a
great quantitie of water); the Indian forsaketh not his
holde, but riseth with him, and thrusteth in a logg into
one of his spowters, and with the other knocketh it in so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
fast, that by no meanes the whale can get it out. That
fastned, at another opportunitie, he thrusteth in the second
logg into the other spowter, and with all the force he can,
keepeth it in.</p>

<p>The whale not being able to breath, swimmeth presently
ashore, and the Indian a cock-horse upon him, which his
fellowes discovering, approach to helpe him, and to make
an end of him: it serveth them for their foode many dayes
after.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>Since the Spaniards have taught them the estimation of
amber greece, they seeke curiously for it, sell it to them,
and others, for such things as they best fancie, and most
esteeme; which are, as I have beene enformed, all sortes
of edge tooles, copper, glasses, glasse-beads, red caps, shirts,
and pedlery ware. Upon this subject, divers Spaniards
have discoursed unto mee, who have beene eye witnesses
thereof, declaring them to be valorous, ventrous, and industrious:
otherwise they durst not undertake an enterprise
so difficult and full of danger.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXI.</h3>

<p>Betwixt nineteene and twenty degrees to the south-wards
of the lyne, the winde tooke us contrary, which together
with the sicknes of my people made mee to seeke the shore;
and about the end of October, we had sight of the land,
which presently by our height and the making of it, discovered
it selfe to be the port of Santos, alias Nostra Senora
de Victoria, and is easie to be knowne, for it hath a
great high hill over the port, which (howsoever a man
commeth with the land) riseth like a bell, and comming
neere the shore, presently is discovered a white tower or
fort, which standeth upon the top of a hill over the harbour,
and upon the seamost land. It is the first land a man must
compasse before he enter the port. Comming within two
leagues of the shore, we anchored; and the captaynes and
masters of my other ships being come aboord, it was
thought convenient (the weaknes of our men considered,
for wee had not in our three ships twenty foure men
sound), and the winde uncertaine when it might change,
we thought with pollicie to procure that which wee could
not by force; and so to offer traffique to the people of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
shore; by that meanes to prove if wee could attayne some
refreshing for our sicke company.</p>

<p>In execution whereof, I wrote a letter to the governour
in Latine, and sent him with it a peece of crymson velvet,
a bolt of fine holland, with divers other things, as a present;
and with it, the captaine of my ship, who spake a
little broken Spanish, giving the governour to understand
that I was bound to the East Indies, to traffique in those
parts, and that contrary windes had forced me upon that
coast: if that hee were pleased to like of it, for the commodities
the country yeelded in aboundance, I would exchange
that which they wanted. With these instructions
my captaine departed about nine of the clocke in the
morning, carrying a flagge of truce in the head of the
boate, and sixteene men well armed, and provided; guided
by one of my company which two yeares before had beene
captaine in that place, and so was a reasonable pilot.</p>

<p>Entering the port, within a quarter of a mile is a small
village, and three leagues higher up is the chief towne;
where they have two forts, one on eyther side of the harbour,
and within them ride the ships which come thither
to discharge, or loade. In the small village is ever a
garrison of one hundreth souldiers, whereof part assist
there continually, and in the white tower upon the top of
the hill, which commaundeth it.</p>

<p>Heere my captaine had good entertainment, and those
of the shore received his message and letter, dispatching it
presently to the governour, who was some three leagues
off in another place: at least they beare us so in hand. In
the time that they expected the post, my captaine with one
other entertained himselfe with the souldiers a shore, who
after the common custome of their profession (except when
they be <i>besonios</i>),<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> sought to pleasure him, and finding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
that he craved but oranges, lemmons, and matters of smal
moment for refreshing for his generall, they suffered the
women and children to bring him what hee would, which
hee gratified with double pistolets,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> that I had given him
for that purpose. So got hee us two or three hundreth
oranges and lemmons, and some fewe hennes.</p>

<p>All that day and night, and the next day, till nine of the
clocke, wee waited the returne of our boate; which not
appearing, bred in me some suspition; and for my satisfaction,
I manned a light horseman which I had, and the
<i>Fancie</i>, the best I could, shewing strength where was weaknesse
and infirmity, and so set sayle towardes the port;
our gunner taking upon him to bee pilot, for that he had
beene there some yeares before.</p>

<p>Thus, with them we entred the harbour. My captaine
having notice of our being within the barre, came aboord
with the boat, which was no small joy to me; and more, to
see him bring us store of oranges and lemmons, which
was that we principally sought for, as the remedie of our
diseased company. He made relation of that had past, and
how they expected present answere from the governour.
We anchored right against the village; and within two
houres, by a flagge of truce, which they on the shore shewed
us, we understood that the messenger was come: our boat
went for the answere of the governour, who said, he was
sorry that he could not accomplish our desire, being so
reasonable and good; for that in consideration of the warre
betwixt Spaine and England, he had expresse order from
his king, not to suffer any English to trade within his
jurisdiction, no, nor to land, or to take any refreshing upon
the shore. And therefore craved pardon, and that wee
should take this for a resolute answere: and further required
us to depart the port within three dayes, which he said he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
gave us for our courteous manner of proceeding. If any
of my people from that time forwards, should approach to
the shore, that he would doe his best to hinder and annoy
them. With this answere wee resolved to depart; and before
it came, with the first faire wind we determined to be
packing: but the wind suffered us not all that night, nor
the next day. In which time, I lived in a great perplexitie,
for that I knew our own weaknesse, and what they might
doe unto us, if that they had knowne so much. For any
man that putteth himself into the enemies port, had need
of Argus eyes, and the wind in a bagge,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> especially where
the enemie is strong, and the tydes of any force. For with
either ebbe or flood, those who are on the shore may
thrust upon him inventions of fire: and with swimming or
other devises, may cut his cables. A common practise in
all hot countries. The like may be effected with raffes,
cannoas, boates, or pynaces, to annoy and assault him:
and if this had beene practised against us, or taken effect,
our shippes must of force have yeelded themselves; for
they had no other people in them but sicke men; but
many times opinion and feare preserveth the shippes, and
not the people in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For prevention
of annoyances,
etc., in
harbours.</div>

<p>Wherefore it is the part of a provident governour, to
consider well the daungers that may befall him, before he
put himselfe into such places; so shall he ever be provided
for prevention.</p>

<p>In Saint John de Vlua, in the New Spaine, when the
Spanyards dishonoured their nation with that foule act of
perjury, and breach of faith, given to my father, Sir John
Hawkins (notorious to the whole world), the Spanyards
fired two great shippes, with intention to burne my fathers
<i>Admirall</i>, which he prevented by towing them with his
boates another way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>The great armado of Spaine, sent to conquer England,
anno 1588, was with that selfe same industry overthrowne;
for the setting on fire of six or seaven shippes (whereof two
were mine), and letting them drive with the flood, forced
them to cut their cables, and to put to sea, to seeke a new
way to Spaine.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> In which the greatest part of their best
shippes and men were lost and perished.</p>

<p>For that my people should not be dismayed, I dispatched
presently my light horsman, with onely foure men, and
part of the refreshing, advising them that with the first
calme or slent<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> of wind, they should come off.</p>

<p>The next night, the wind comming off the shore, wee set
sayle, and with our boates and barkes sounded as we went.</p>

<p>It flowed upon the barre not above foure foote water,
and once in foure and twentie houres, as in some parts of
the West Indies; at full sea, there is not upon the barre
above seventeen or eighteen foote water. The harbour
runneth to the south-westwards. He that will come into
it, is to open the harbour’s mouth a good quarter of a
league before he beare with it, and be bolder of the wester
side; for of the easterland<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> lyeth a great ledge of rocks, for
the most part, under water, which sometimes break not;
but with small shipping, a man may goe betwixt them and
the poynt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vertue
of oranges.</div>

<p>Comming aboord of our shippes, there was great joy
amongst my company; and many, with the sight of the
oranges and lemmons, seemed to recover heart. This is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
wonderfull secret of the power and wisedome of God, that
hath hidden so great and unknowne vertue in this fruit, to
be a certaine remedie for this infirmitie; I presently caused
them all to be reparted<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> amongst our sicke men, which
were so many, that there came not above three or foure to
a share: but God was pleased to send us a prosperous
winde the next day, so much to our comfort, that not any
one dyed before we came to the ilands, where we pretended
to refresh ourselves; and although our fresh water had
fayled us many dayes before we saw the shore, by reason
of our long navigation, without touching any land, and the
excessive drinking of the sicke and diseased, which could
not be excused, yet with an invention I had in my shippe,
<span class="sidenote">Distilling of
salt water.</span>
I easily drew out of the water of the sea, sufficient
quantitie of fresh water to sustaine my people with little
expence of fewell; for with foure billets I stilled a hogs-head
of water, and therewith dressed the meat for the sicke
and whole. The water so distilled, we found to be wholesome
and nourishing.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<h3>SECTION XXII.</h3>

<p>The coast from Santos to Cape Frio, lyeth west and by
south, southerly. So we directed our course west south-west.
The night comming on, and directions given to
our other shippes, we sett the watch, having a fayre
fresh gale of wind and large. My selfe with the master
of our ship, having watched the night past, thought now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
to give nature that which shee had beene deprived of,
and so recommended the care of steeridge to one of his
mates;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> who with the like travell past being drowsie, or
<span class="sidenote">Unskilfulnesse
of the
masters
mate.</span>
with the confidence which he had of him at the helme, had
not that watchfull care which was required; he at the
helme steered west, and west and by south, and brought
us in a little time close upon the shore;<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> doubtlesse he had
cast us all away, had not God extraordinarily delivered us;
for the master being in his dead sleepe, was suddenly
<span class="sidenote">Providence
of God, and
the care of
the master.</span>
awaked, and with such a fright that he could not be in
quiet: whereupon waking his youth, which ordinarily
slept in his cabin by him, asked him how the watch went
on; who answered, that it could not be above an houre
since he layd himselfe to rest. He replyed, that his heart
was so unquiet that he could not by any meanes sleepe,
and so taking his gowne, came forth upon the deck, and
presently discovered the land hard by us. And for that it
was sandie and low, those who had their eyes continually
fixed on it, were dazeled with the reflection of the starres,
being a fayre night, and so were hindered from the true
discovery thereof. But he comming out of the darke, had
his sight more forcible, to discerne the difference of the
sea, and the shore. So that forthwith he commaunded
him at the helme, to put it close a starbourd, and tacking
our ship, wee edged off; and sounding, found scant three
fathome water, whereby we saw evidently the miraculous
mercie of our God; that if he had not watched over us, as
hee doth continually over his, doubtlesse we had perished
without remedie. To whom be all glory, and prayse everlastingly,
world without end.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>Immediatly we shot off a peece, to give warning to our
other shippes; who having kept their direct course, and far
to wind-wards and sea-wards, because we carried no light,
for that we were within sight of the shore, could not heare
the report; and the next morning were out of sight.</p>

the compasse; and have another before them, whereby
they see what they doe, and are ever witnesses of the good

have seene neglected in our best shippes, yet nothing more
necessary to be reformed. For a good helme-man may be

<h3>SECTION XXIV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Cape Blanco.</div>

<p>The next day about tenne of the clocke, wee were thwart
of Cape Blanco,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> which is low sandie land, and perilous;
for foure leagues into the sea (thwart it), lye banks of
sand, which have little water on them; on a sudden we
found our selves amongst them, in lesse then three fathome
water; but with our boat and shalope we went sounding,
and so got cleare of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saint James
ilands, alias
Saint Annes.</div>

<p>The next day following, we discovered the ilands where
wee purposed to refresh ourselves. They are two, and some
call them Saint James, his ilands, and others, Saint Annes.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
They lie in two and twenty degrees and a halfe to the
south-wards of the lyne; and towards the evening (being
the fifth of November) we anchored betwixt them and the
mayne, in six fathome water, where wee found our other
shippes.</p>

<p>All which being well moored, we presently began to set
up tents and booths for our sicke men, to carry them a
shore, and to use our best diligence to cure them. For
which intent our three surgeans, with their servants and
adherents, had two boates to wayte continually upon them,
to fetch whatsoever was needfull from the shippes, to procure
refreshing, and to fish, either with netts, or hookes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
and lynes. Of these implements wee had in aboundance,
and it yeelded us some refreshing. For the first dayes, the
most of those which had health, occupied themselves in
romeging our ship; in bringing ashore of emptie caske;
in filling of them, and in felling and cutting of wood:
which being many workes, and few hands, went slowly forwards.</p>

<p>Neere these ilands, are two great rockes, or small ilands
adjoyning. In them we found great store of young gannetts
<span class="sidenote">Gannets.</span>
in their nests, which we reserved for the sicke, and
being boyled with pickled porke well watered,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and mingled
with oatmeale, made reasonable pottage, and was good refreshing
and sustenance for them. This provision fayled
us not, till our departure from them.</p>

<p>Upon one of these rocks also, we found great store of
<span class="sidenote">Purslane.</span>
the hearbe purslane,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> which boyled and made into sallets,
with oyle and vineger, refreshed the sicke stomaches, and
gave appetite.</p>

<p>With the ayre of the shore, and good cherishing, many
recovered speedily. Some died away quickly, and others
continued at a stand. We found here some store of fruits;
<span class="sidenote">Cherries.</span>
a kind of cherry that groweth upon a tree like a plum-tree,
red of colour, with a stone in it, but different in making to
ours, for it is not altogether round, and dented about: they
have a pleasing taste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palmitos.</div>

<p>In one of the ilands, we found palmito trees, great and
high, and in the toppe a certaine fruit like cocos, but no
bigger then a wall-nut. We found also a fruit growing
upon trees in codds, like beanes, both in the codd and the
fruit. Some of my company proved of them,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> and they

They have hudds, as our beanes, which shaled off; the kernell
parteth itselfe in two, and in the middle is a thin
skinne, like that of an onion, said to be hurtfull, and to
cause exceeding vomits, and therefore to be cast away.</p>

they are to be prepared by peeling them first, and then
taking away the skinne in the middle, and after beaten into
powder, to take the quantitie of five or six, either with wine
or sugar. Thus they are good against fevers, and to purge
grosse humors; against the collicke, and payne of the
joynts; in taking them a man may not sleepe, but is to use
the dyet usuall, as in a day of purging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artechoques
or prick-peares.</div>

<p>One other fruit we found, very pleasant in taste, in
fashion of an artechoque, but lesse; on the outside of
colour redd, within white, and compassed about with
prickles; our people called them pricke-pears;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> no conserve
is better. They grow upon the leaves of a certaine roote,
that is like unto that which we call <i>semper viva</i><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and many
are wont to hang them up in their houses; but their leaves
are longer and narrower, and full of prickes on either side.
The fruit groweth upon the side of the leafe, and is one of
the best fruites that I have eaten in the Indies. In ripening,
presently the birds or vermine are feeding on them;
<span class="sidenote">A good note
to take or
refuse unknowne

a generall rule to know what fruit is wholesome and good
in the Indies, and other parts. Finding them to be eaten
of the beastes or fowles, a man may boldly eate of them.</p>

<p>The water of these ilands is not good: the one, for being
a standing water, and full of venemous wormes and serpents,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
which is neare a butt-shot from the sea shore; where
we found a great tree fallen, and in the roote of it the
names of sundry Portingalls, Frenchmen, and others, and
amongst them, Abraham Cockes; with the time of their
being in this island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contagious
water.</div>

<p>The other, though a running water, yet passing by the
rootes of certaine trees, which have a smell as that of garlique,
taketh a certaine contagious sent of them. Here
two of our men dyed with swelling of their bellies. The
accident we could not attribute to any other cause, then
to this suspitious water. It is little, and falleth into the
sand, and soketh through it into the sea; and therefore we
made a well of a pipe, and placeth it under the rocke from
which it falleth, and out of it filled our caske: but we
could not fill above two tunnes in a night and day.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXV.</h3>

<p>So after our people began to gather their strength, wee
manned our boates, and went over to the mayne, where
presently we found a great ryver of fresh and sweete water,
and a mightie marish countrie; which in the winter<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
seemeth to be continually over-flowne with this river, and
others, which fall from the mountaynous country adjacent.</p>

<p>We rowed some leagues up the ryver, and found that the
further up we went, the deeper was the river, but no fruit,
more then the sweate of our bodies for the labour of our
handes.</p>

<p>At our returne, wee loaded our boate with water, and
afterwardes from hence wee made our store.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXVI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Wast and
losse of men.</div>

<p>The sicknesse having wasted more then the one halfe of
my people, we determined to take out the victualls of the
<i>Hawke</i>, and to burne her; which wee put in execution.
And being occupied in this worke, we saw a shippe turning
to windwards, to succour her selfe of the ilands;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> but having
discryed us, put off to sea-wards.</p>

<p>Two dayes after, the wind changing, we saw her againe
running alongst the coast, and the <i>Daintie</i> not being in
case to goe after her, for many reasons, we manned the
<i>Fancie</i>, and sent her after her; who about the setting of
the sunne fetched her up, and spake with her; when finding
her to be a great fly-boat, of at least three or foure
hundreth tunnes, with eighteen peeces of artillery, would
have returned, but the wind freshing in, put her to leewards;
and standing in to succour her selfe of the land,
had sight of another small barke, which after a short chase
shee tooke, but had nothing of moment in her, for that she
had bin upon the great sholes of Abreoios,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> in eighteen
degrees, and there throwne all they had by the board, to
save their lives.</p>

<p>This and the other chase were the cause that the <i>Fancie</i>
could not beat it up in many dayes: but before we had
put all in a readinesse, the wind changing, shee came unto
us, and made relation of that which had past; and how
they had given the small barke to the Portingalls, and
brought with them onely her pilot, and a marchant called
Pedro de Escalante of Potosi.

<h3>SECTION XXVII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Industry of
the Indians.
They surprise
the
French.</div>

<p>In this coast, the Portingalls, by industrie of the Indians,
have wrought many feats. At Cape Frio they tooke a
great French ship in the night, the most of her company
being on the shore, with cannoas,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> which they have in this
coast so great, that they carry seventie and eightie men in
one of them. And in Isla Grand, I saw one that was above
threescore foote long, of one tree, as are all that I have
seen in Brasill, with provisions in them for twentie or
<span class="sidenote">San Sebastian.</span>
thirtie days. At the iland of San-Sebastian, neere Saint
Vincent, the Indians killed about eightie of Master Candish
<span class="sidenote">Kill the
English,</span>
his men, and tooke his boat, which was the overthrow
of his voyage.</p>

<p>There commeth not any ship upon this coast, whereof
these cannoas give not notice presently to every place.
And wee were certified in Isla Grand, that they had sent
<span class="sidenote">and discover
us.</span>
an Indian from the river of Ienero, through all the mountaines
and marishes, to take a view of us, and accordingly
made a relation of our shippes, boates, and the number of
men which we might have. But to prevent the like danger
that might come upon us being carelesse and negligent, I
determined one night, in the darkest and quietest of it, to
see what watch our company kept on the shore; manned
our light horsman, and boat, armed them with bowes and
targetts, and got a shore some good distance from the
places where were our boothes, and sought to come upon
them undiscovered: we used all our best endevours to take
them at unawares, yet comming within fortie paces, we
were discovered; the whole and the sicke came forth to
oppose themselves against us. Which we seeing, gave
them the hubbub, after the manner of the Indians, and
assaulted them, and they us; but being a close darke night,
they could not discerne us presently upon the hubbub.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>From our shippe the gunner shott a peece of ordinance
over our heads, according to the order given him, and
thereof we tooke occasion to retyre unto our boates, and
within a little space came to the boothes and landing places,
as though wee came from our shippes to ayd them. They
<span class="sidenote">The events
of a good
watch.</span>
began to recount unto us, how that at the wester poynt of
the iland, out of certaine cannoas, had landed a multitude
of Indians, which with a great out-cry came upon them,
and assaulted them fiercely; but finding better resistance
then they looked for, and seeing themselves discovered by
the shippes, tooke themselves to their heeles and returned
to their cannoas, in which they imbarked themselves, and
departed. One affirmed, he saw the cannoas; another,
their long hayre; a third, their bowes; a fourth, that it
could not be, but that some of them had their payments.
And it was worth the sight, to behold those which had not
moved out of their beds in many moneths, unlesse by the
helpe of others, gotten some a bow-shoot off into the woods,
others into the toppes of trees, and those which had any
strength, joyned together to fight for their lives. In fine,
the boothes and tents were left desolate.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>To colour our businesse the better, after we had spent
some houres in seeking out and joyning the companie together,
in comforting, animating, and commending them,
I left them an extraordinary guard for that night, and so
departed to our shippes, with such an opinion of the assault
given by the Indians, that many so possessed, through all
the voyage, would not be perswaded to the contrary.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Which impression wrought such effect in most of my
companie, that in all places where the Indians might annoy
us, they were ever after most carefull and vigilant, as was
convenient.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>In these ilands it heigheth and falleth some five or six
foot water, and but once in two and twentie houres; as in
all this coast, and in many parts of the West Indies; as
also in the coast of Perew and Chely, saving where are
great bayes or indraughts, and there the tydes keep their
ordinary course of twice in foure and twentie houres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palmito
iland.</div>

<p>In the lesser of these ilands, is a cave for a small ship
to ryde in, land-lockt, and shee may moore her sele to the
trees of either side. This we called Palmito iland, for the
aboundance it hath of the greater sort of palmito trees; the
other hath none at all. A man may goe betwixt the ilands
with his ship, but the better course is out at one end.</p>

<p>In these ilands are many scorpions, snakes, and adders,
with other venemous vermine. They have parrots, and a
certaine kinde of fowle like unto pheasants, somewhat
bigger, and seeme to be of their nature. Here we spent
above a moneth in curing of our sicke men, supplying our
wants of wood and water, and in other necessary workes.
And the tenth of December, all things put in order, we set
sayle for Cape Frio, having onely six men sicke, with purpose
there to set ashore our two prisoners before named;
and anchoring under the Cape, we sent our boat a shore,
but they could not finde any convenient place to land them
in, and so returned.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The wind being southerly, and not
good to goe on our voyage, we succoured our selves within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Isla Grand, which lyeth some dozen or fourteene leagues
from the cape, betwixt the west, and by south and west
south-west; the rather to set our prisoners a shore.</p>

<p>In the mid-way betwixt the Cape and this iland, lyeth
<span class="sidenote">Ienero.</span>
the river Ienero, a very good harbour, fortified with a
garrison, and a place well peopled. The Isla Grand is
some eight or ten leagues long, and causeth a goodly harbour
for shipping. It is full of great sandie bayes, and in
the most of them is store of good water; within this iland
are many other smaller ilands, which cause divers sounds
<span class="sidenote">Little iland.</span>
and creekes; and amongst these little ilands, one, for the
pleasant scituation and fertilitie thereof, called Placentia.
This is peopled, all the rest desert: on this island our
prisoners desired to be put a shore, and promised to send
us some refreshing. Whereto we condescended, and sent
them ashore, with two boates well man’d and armed, who
found few inhabitants in the iland; for our people saw not
above foure or five houses, notwithstanding our boats returned
loaden with plantynes, pinias,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> potatoes, sugar-canes,
and some hennes. Amongst which they brought a
kind of little plantyne, greene, and round, which were the
best of any that I have seene.</p>

<p>With our people came a Portingall, who said, that the
island was his; he seemed to be a Mistecho, who are those
that are of a Spanish and an Indian brood, poorely apparelled
and miserable; we feasted him, and gave him
some trifles, and he, according to his abilitie, answered our
courtesie with such as he had.</p>

<p>The wind continuing contrary, we emptied all the water
wee could come by, which we had filled in Saint James his
<span class="sidenote">Isla Grand.</span>
iland, and filled our caske with the water of this Isla
Grand. It is a wildernesse, covered with trees and shrubs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
so thicke, as it hath no passage through, except a man make
it by force. And it was strange to heare the howling and
cryes of wilde beastes in these woods day and night, which
we could not come at to see by any meanes; some like
lyons, others like beares, others like hoggs, and of such
and so many diversities, as was admirable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shells of
mother of
pearle.</div>

<p>Heere our nets profited us much; for in the sandy bayes
they tooke us store of fish. Upon the shore, at full seamark,
we found in many places certaine shels, like those of
mother of pearles, which are brought out of the East Indies,
to make standing cups, called <i>caracoles</i>; of so great curiositie
as might move all the beholders to magnifie the
maker of them: and were it not for the brittlenes of them,
by reason of their exceeding thinnes, doubtles they were
to bee esteemed farre above the others; for, more excellent
workemanship I have not seene in shels.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>The eighteenth of December, we set sayle, the wind at
north-east, and directed our course for the Straites of
Magalianes. The twenty two of this moneth, at the going
too of the sunne, we descryed a Portingall ship, and gave
her chase, and comming within hayling of her, shee rendred
her selfe without any resistance; shee was of an hundred
tuns, bound for Angola, to load negroes, to be carried and
sold in the river of Plate. It is a trade of great profit, and
much used, for that the negroes are carried from the head
of the river of Plate, to Patosi, to labour in the mynes. It
<span class="sidenote">Price of
negroes.</span>
is a bad negro, who is not worth there five or six hundreth
peeces, every peece of tenne ryals, which they receive in
ryals of plate,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> for there is no other marchandize in those
partes. Some have told me, that of late they have found
out the trade and benefit of cochanillia, but the river
suffereth not vessels of burthen; for if they drawe above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
eight or seaven foote water, they cannot goe further then
the mouth of the river, and the first habitation is above a
hundred and twenty leagues up, whereunto many barkes
trade yearely, and carry all kinde of marchandize serving
for Patosi and Paraquay; the money which is thence returned,
is distributed in all the coast of Brasill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassavi
meale.</div>

<p>The loading of this ship was meale of cassavi, which the
Portingals call <i>Farina de Paw</i>. It serveth for marchandize
in Angola, for the Portingals foode in the ship, and
to nourish the negroes which they should carry to the river
of Plate. This meale is made of a certaine roote which the
Indians call <i>yuca</i>, much like unto potatoes. Of it are two
kindes: the one sweete and good to be eaten (either rosted
or sodden) as potatoes, and the other of which they make
their bread, called <i>cassavi</i>; deadly poyson, if the liquor or
juyce bee not thoroughly pressed out. So prepared it is
the bread of Brazill, and many parts of the Indies, which
they make in this maner: first they pare the roote, and
<span class="sidenote">The preparing
thereof
for food.</span>
then upon a rough stone they grate it as small as they can,
and after that it is grated small, they put it into a bag or
poke, and betwixt two stones, with great waight, they
presse out the juyce or poyson, and after keepe it in some
bag, till it hath no juyce nor moysture left.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Of this they
make two sorts of bread, the one finer and the other
courser, but bake them after one maner. They place a
great broad smooth stone upon other foure, which serve in
steede of a trevet, and make a quicke fire under it, and so
strawe the flower or meale a foote long, and halfe a foot
broad. To make it to incorporate, they sprinkle now and
then a little water, and then another rowe of meale, and
another sprinkling, till it be to their minde; that which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
to be spent presently, they make a finger thicke, and sometimes
more thicke; but that which they make for store, is
not above halfe a finger thicke, but so hard, that if it fall
on the ground it will not breake easily. Being newly
baked, it is reasonable good, but after fewe dayes it is not
to be eaten, except it be soaked in water. In some partes
they suffer the meale to become fenoed,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> before they make
it into bread, and hold it for the best, saying that it giveth
it a better tast; but I am not of that opinion. In other
parts they mingle it with a fruite called agnanapes, which
are round, and being ripe are grey, and as big as an hazell
nut, and grow in a cod like pease, but that it is all curiously
wrought: first they parch them upon a stone, and after
beate them into powder, and then mingle them with the
fine flower of cassavi, and bake them into bread, these are
their spice-cakes, which they call <i>xauxaw</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agnanapes.</div>

<p>The agnanapes are pleasant, give the bread a yellowish
coulour, and an aromaticall savour in taste.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The finer of
this bread, being well baked, keepeth long time, three or
foure yeares. In Brazill, since the Portingalls taught the
Indians the use of sugar, they eate this meale mingled with
remels<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> of sugar, or malasses; and in this manner the Portingalls
themselves feed of it.</p>

<p>But we found a better manner of dressing this farina, in
making pancakes, and frying them with butter or oyle, and
sometimes with <i>manteca de puerco</i>; when strewing a little
sugar upon them, it was meate that our company desired
above any that was in the shippe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And for
beverage.</div>

<p>The Indians also accustome to make their drinke of this
meale, and in three severall manners.</p>

<p>First is chewing it in their mouths, and after mingling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
it with water, after a loathsome manner, yet the commonest
drinke that they have; and that held best which is
chewed by an old woman.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The second manner of their drinke, is baking it till it be
halfe burned, then they beate it into powder; and when
they will drinke, they mingle a small quantitie of it with
water, which giveth a reasonable good taste.</p>

<p>The third, and best, is baking it, as aforesaid, and when
it is beaten into powder, to seeth it in water; after that
it is well boyled, they let it stand some three or foure
dayes, and then drinke it. So, it is much like the ale which
is used in England, and of that colour and taste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The manner
of planting
<i>yuca</i>.</div>

<p>The Indians are very curious in planting and manuring
of this <i>yuca</i>. It is a little shrubb, and carryeth branches
like hazell wands; being growne as bigge as a mans finger,
they breake them off in the middest, and so pricke them
into the ground; it needeth no other art or husbandry,
for out of each branch grow two, three, or foure rootes,
some bigger, some lesser: but first they burne and manure
the ground, the which labour, and whatsoever els is requisite,
the men doe not so much as helpe with a finger, but all
<span class="sidenote">With the labour
of the
women.</span>
lyeth upon their poore women, who are worse then slaves;
for they labour the ground, they plant, they digge and
delve, they bake, they brew, and dresse their meate, fetch
their water, and doe all drudgerie whatsoever: yea, though
they nurse a childe, they are not exempted from any
labour; their childe they carry in a wallet about their
necke, ordinarily under one arme, because it may sucke
when it will.</p>

<p>The men have care for nothing but for their cannoas, to
passe from place to place, and of their bowes and arrowes
to hunt, and their armes for the warre, which is a sword of
heavie blacke wood, some foure fingers broad, an inch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
thicke, and an ell long, something broader towards the
toppe then at the handle. They call it <i>macana</i>, and it is
carved and wrought with inlayd works very curiously, but
his edges are blunt. If any kill any game in hunting, he
bringeth it not with him, but from the next tree to the
game, he breaketh a bough (for the trees in the Indies have
leaves for the most part all the yeare), and all the way as
he goeth streweth little peeces of it, here and there, and
comming home giveth a peece to his woman, and so sends
her for it.</p>

<p>If they goe to the warre, or in any journey, where it is
necessary to carry provision or marchandize, the women
serve to carry all, and the men never succour nor ease
them; wherein they shew greater barbarisme then in any
thing, in my opinion, that I have noted amongst them,
except in eating one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polygamy of
the Indians.</div>

<p>In Brasill, and in the West Indies, the Indian may have
as many wives as he can get, either bought or given by her
friends: the men and women, for the most part, goe
<span class="sidenote">Their attire.</span>
naked, and those which have come to know their shame,
cover onely their privie parts with a peece of cloth, the rest
of their body is naked. Their houses resemble great
barnes, covered over or thatched with plantyne leaves,
which reach to the ground, and at either end is the
doore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their manner
of
housing.</div>

<p>In one house are sometimes ten or twentie households:
they have little household stuffe, besides their beds, which
call <i>hamacas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> and are made of cotton, and stayned
with divers colours and workes. Some I have seene white,
of great curiositie. They are as a sheete laced at both
ends, and at either end of them long strappes, with which
they fasten them to two posts, as high as a mans middle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
<span class="sidenote">And
sleeping.</span>
and so sit rocking themselves in them. Sometimes they
use them for seates, and sometimes to sleepe in at their
pleasures. In one of them I have seene sleepe the man,
his wife, and a childe.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXVIII.</h3>

<p>We tooke out of this prize, for our provision, some good
quantitie of this meale, and the sugar shee had, being not
above three or foure chestes: after three dayes we gave the
ship to the Portingalls, and to them libertie. In her was
a Portingall knight, which went for governour of Angola,
of the habit of Christ, with fiftie souldiers, and armes for
a hundreth and fiftie, with his wife and daughter. He was
old, and complained, that after many yeares service for his
king, with sundry mishapps, he was brought to that poore
estate, as for the relief of his wife, his daughter, and himselfe,
he had no other substance, but that he had in the
ship. It moved compassion, so as nothing of his was diminished,
which though to us was of no great moment, in
Angola it was worth good crownes. Onely we disarmed
them all, and let them depart, saying that they would returne
to Saint Vincents.</p>

<p>We continued our course for the Straites, my people
much animated with this unlookt for refreshing, and
praised God for his bountie, providence, and grace extended
towards us. Here it will not be out of the way to speake
a word of the particularities of the countrie.

<h3>SECTION XXIX.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The description
of
Brasill.</div>

<p>Brasill is accounted to be that part of America, which
lyeth towards our north sea, betwixt the river of the Amazons,
neere the lyne to the northwards, untill a man come
to the river of Plate in thirty-six degrees to the southwards
of the lyne.</p>

<p>This coast generally lyeth next of any thing south and
by west; it is a temperate countrie, though in some parts
it exceedeth in heat; it is full of good succors for shipping,
<span class="sidenote">Its havens.</span>
and plentifull for rivers and fresh waters; the principal
habitations are, Farnambuca, the Bay De todos los Santos,
Nostra Senora de Victoria, alias Santos, the river Ienero,
Saint Vincents, and Placentia; every of them provided
of a good port. The winds are variable, but for the most
part trade<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> along the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its commodities.</div>

<p>The commodities this country yeeldeth, are the wood
called Brasill,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> whereof the best is that of Farnambuc; (so
also called, being used in most rich colours) good cotton-wooll,
great store of sugar, balsamon, and liquid amber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its wants.</div>

<p>They have want of all maner of cloth, lynnen, and
wollen, of iron, and edge-tools, of copper, and principally
in some places, of wax, of wine, of oyle, and meale (for
the country beareth no corne), and of all maner of haberdashery-wares,
for the Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bestiall
thereof.</div>

<p>The beasts that naturally breed in this country are,
tygers, lyons, hoggs, dogges, deere, monkeyes, mycos, and
conies (like unto ratts, but bigger, and of a tawney colour),
armadilloes, alagartoes, and store of venemous wormes and
serpents, as scorpions, adders, which they call vinoras;
and of them, one kind, which the divine Providence hath
created with a bell upon his head, that wheresoever he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
goeth, the sound of it might be heard, and so the serpent
shunned; for his stinging is without remedie. This they
call the vynora with the bell; of them there are many,
and great stores of snakes, them of that greatnesse, as
to write the truth, might seeme fabulous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The discommodities.</div>

<p>Another worm there is in this country, which killed
many of the first inhabitants, before God was pleased to
discover a remedie for it, unto a religious person; it is like
a magot, but more slender, and longer, and of a greene
colour, with a red head; this worme creepeth in at the
hinder parts, where is the evacuation of our superfluities,
and there, as it were, gleweth himselfe to the gutt, there
feedeth of the bloud and humors, and becommeth so great,
that stopping the naturall passage, he forceth the principall
wheele of the clocke of our bodie to stand still, and
with it the accompt of the houres of life to take end, with
most cruell torment and paine, which is such, that he who
hath beene throughly punished with the collique can
quickly decipher or demonstrate. The antidote for this
pernicious worme is garlique; and this was discovered by
a physitian to a religious person.</p>

<h3>SECTION XXX.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Santa
Catalina.</div>

<p>Betwixt twenty-six and twenty-seven degrees neere the
coast lyeth an iland; the Portingalls call it Santa Catalina,
which is a reasonable harbour, and hath good refreshing
of wood, water, and fruit. It is desolate, and serveth for
those who trade from Brasill to the river of Plate, or from
the river to Brasill, as an inne, or bayting place.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Variation of
the compasse.</div>

<p>In our navigation towards the Straites, by our observation
wee found, that our compasse varyed a poynt and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
better to the eastwards. And for that divers have written
curiously and largely of the variation thereof, I referre
them that desire the understanding of it, to the <i>Discourse</i>
of Master William Aborrawh, and others; for it is a secret,
whose causes well understood are of greatest moment in
all navigations.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>In the height of the river of Plate, we being some fiftie
leagues off the coast, a storme took us southerly, which
endured fortie-eight houres.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> In the first day, about the
going downe of the sunne, Robert Tharlton, master of the
<i>Fancie</i>, bare up before the wind, without giving us any
token or signe that shee was in distresse. We seeing her
to continue her course, bare up after her, and the night
comming on, we carried our light; but shee never answered
us; for they kept their course directly for England, which
<span class="sidenote">The overthrow
of
the voyage.</span>
was the overthrow of the voyage, as well for that we had
no pynace to goe before us, to discover any danger, to seeke
out roades and anchoring, to helpe our watering and refreshing;
as also for the victuals, necessaries, and men
which they carryed away with them: which though they
were not many, yet with their helpe in our fight, we had
taken the Vice-Admirall, the first time shee bourded with
us, as shall be hereafter manifested. For once we cleered
her decke, and had we beene able to have spared but a
dozen men, doubtlesse we had done with her what we
would; for shee had no close fights.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause.</div>

<p>Moreover, if shee had beene with me, I had not beene
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
discovered upon the coast of Perew. But I was worthy to
be deceived, that trusted my ship in the hands of an hypocrite,
and a man which had left his generall before in the
<span class="sidenote">Infidelitie.</span>
like occasion, and in the selfe-same place; for being with
Master Thomas Candish, master of a small ship in the
voyage wherein he dyed, this captaine being aboord the
Admirall, in the night time forsooke his fleet, his generall
and captaine, and returned home.</p>

<p>This bad custome is too much used amongst sea-men,
and worthy to be severely punished; for doubtlesse the
not punishing of those offenders hath beene the prime
cause of many lamentable events, losses, and overthrowes,
to the dishonour of our nation, and frustrating of many
good and honourable enterprises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discipline of
the Spanish.</div>

<p>In this poynt of dicipline, the Spaniards doe farre surpasse
us; for whosoever forsaketh his fleete, or commander,
is not onely severely punished, but deprived also of all
charge or government for ever after. This in our countrie
is many times neglected; for that there is none to follow
the cause, the principalls being either dead with griefe, or
drowned in the gulfe of povertie, and so not able to wade
through with the burthen of that suite, which in Spaine is
prosecuted by the kings atturney, or fiscall; or at least, a
judge appoynted for determining that cause purposely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The only
cause of their
prosperities.</div>

<p>Yea, I cannot attribute the good successe the Spaniard
hath had in his voyages and peoplings, to any extraordinary
vertue more in him then in any other man, were not discipline,
patience, and justice far superior. For in valour,
experience, and travell, he surpasseth us not; in shipping,
preparation, and plentie of vitualls, hee commeth not neere
us; in paying and rewarding our people, no nation did goe
beyond us: but God, who is a just and bountifull rewarder,
regarding obedience farre above sacrifice, doubtlesse, in
recompence of their indurance, resolution, and subjection
to commandment, bestoweth upon them the blessing due
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
unto it. And this, not for that the Spaniard is of a more
tractable disposition, or more docible nature than wee, but
that justice halteth with us, and so the old proverbe is
verified, <i>Pittie marreth the whole cittie</i>.</p>

<p>Thus come we to be deprived of the sweet fruit, which
the rod of dicipline bringeth with it, represented unto us
in auncient verses, which as a relique of experience I have
heard in my youth recorded by a wise man, and a great
captaine, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The rod by power divine, and earthly regall law,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which makes the good to joy such justice for to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rod of dicipline breeds feare in every part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reward by due desert doth joy and glad the heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The cunning
of runnawayes.</div>

<p>These absentings and escapes are made most times onely
to pilfer and steale, as well by taking of some prise when they
are alone, and without commaund, to hinder or order their
bad proceedings, as to appropriate that which is in their
intrusted ship; casting the fault, if they be called to account,
upon some poore and unknowne mariners, whom they suffer
with a little pillage to absent themselves, the cunninglier
to colour their greatest disorders, and robberies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And ignoble
captaines.</div>

<p>For doubtlesse, if he would, hee might have come unto
us with great facilitie; because within sixteene houres the
storme ceased, and the winde came fayre, which brought
us to the Straites, and dured many days after with us at
north-east. This was good for them, though naught for
us: if he had perished any mast or yard, sprung any leake,
wanted victuals, or instruments for finding us, or had had
any other impediment of importance, hee might have had
some colour to cloake his lewdnes:<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> but his masts and yards
being sound, his shippe staunch and loaden with victuales
for two yeares at the least, and having order from place to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
place, where to finde us, his intention is easily seene to bee
bad, and his fault such, as worthily deserved to bee made
<span class="sidenote">Verified at
their returne.</span>
exemplary unto others. Which he manifested at his returne,
by his manner of proceeding, making a spoyle of
the prise hee tooke in the way homewards, as also of that
which was in the ship, putting it into a port fit for his
purpose, where he might have time and commodity to doe
what hee would.</p>

<p>Wee made account that they had beene swallowed up of
the sea, for we never suspected that anything could make
them forsake us; so, we much lamented them. The storme
ceasing, and being out of all hope, we set sayle and went
<span class="sidenote">Birds like
swans.</span>
on our course. During this storme, certaine great
fowles, as big as swannes, soared about us, and the
winde calming, setled themselves in the sea, and fed
upon the sweepings of our ship; which I perceiving,
and desirous to see of them, because they seemed farre
<span class="sidenote">Caught with
line and
hooke.</span>
greater then in truth they were, I caused a hooke and
lyne to be brought me; and with a peece of a pilchard
I bayted the hook, and a foot from it, tyed a peece of corke,
that it might not sinke deepe, and threw it into the sea,
which, our ship driving with the sea, in a little time was a
good space from us, and one of the fowles being hungry,
presently seized upon it, and the hooke in his upper
beake. It is like to a faulcons bill, but that the poynt is
more crooked, in that maner, as by no meanes he could
cleare himselfe, except that the lyne brake, or the hooke
righted: plucking him towards the ship, with the waving
of his wings he eased the waight of his body; and being
brought to the sterne of our ship, two of our company went
downe by the ladder of the poope, and seized on his necke
and wings; but such were the blowes he gave them with
his pinnions, as both left their hand-fast, being beaten
blacke and blewe; we cast a snare about his necke, and
so tryced him into the ship.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Prove good
refreshment.</div>

<p>By the same manner of fishing, we caught so many of
them, as refreshed and recreated all my people for that day.
Their bodies were great, but of little flesh and tender; in
taste answerable to the food whereon they feed.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p>They were of two colours, some white, some gray; they
had three joynts in each wing; and from the poynt of one
wing to the poynt of the other, both stretched out, was
above two fathomes.</p>

<p>The wind continued good with us, till we came to forty-nine
degrees and thirty minutes, where it tooke us westerly,
being, as we made our accompt, some fiftie leagues from the
shore. Betwixt forty-nine and forty-eight degrees, is Port
Saint Julian, a good harbour, and in which a man may grave
his ship, though shee draw fifteene or sixteene foote water:
but care is to be had of the people called Pentagones. They
<span class="sidenote">Care of the

<p>The second of February, about nine of the clocke in the
morning, we discryed land, which bare south-west of us,
which wee looked not for so timely; and comming neerer
and neerer unto it, by the lying, wee could not conjecture
what land it should be; for we were next of anything in
forty-eight degrees, and no platt nor sea-card which we had
made mention of any land which lay in that manner, neere
about that height; in fine, wee brought our lar-bord tacke
aboord, and stood to the north-east-wardes all that day and
night, and the winde continuing westerly and a fayre gale,
wee continued our course alongst the coast the day and
night following. In which time wee made accompt we discoverd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
well neere threescore leagues of the coast. It is
bold, and made small shew of dangers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A description
of the
unknowne
land.</div>

<p>The land is a goodly champion country, and peopled:
we saw many fires, but could not come to speake with the
people; for the time of the yeare was farre spent, to shoot
<span class="sidenote">A caveat
for comming
suddenly too
neere an unknowne
land.</span>
the Straites, and the want of our pynace disabled us for
finding a port or roade; not being discretion with a ship
of charge, and in an unknowne coast, to come neere the
shore before it was sounded; which were causes, together
with the change of winde (good for us to passe the Straite),
that hindered the further discovery of this land, with its
secrets: this I have sorrowed for many times since, for that
it had likelihood to be an excellent country. It hath great
rivers of fresh waters; for the out-shoot of them colours
the sea in many places, as we ran alongst it. It is not
mountaynous, but much of the disposition of England,
and as temperate. The things we noted principally on the
coast, are these following; the westermost poynt of the
land, with which we first fell, is the end of the land to the
west-wardes, as we found afterwards. If a man bring this
poynt south-west, it riseth in three mounts, or round hillockes:
bringing it more westerly, they shoot themselves
all into one; and bringing it easterly, it riseth in two
<span class="sidenote">Poynt Tremountaine.</span>
hillocks. This we call poynt Tremountaine. Some twelve
or foureteene leagues from this poynt to the east-wardes,
fayre by the shore, lyeth a low flat iland of some two
<span class="sidenote">Fayre Iland.</span>
leagues long; we named it Fayre Iland; for it was all
over as greene and smooth, as any meddow in the spring
of the yeare.</p>

<p>Some three or foure leagues easterly from this iland, is
a goodly opening, as of a great river, or an arme of the
sea, with a goodly low countrie adjacent. And eight or
tenne leagues from this opening, some three leagues from
the shore, lyeth a bigge rocke, which at the first wee had
thought to be a shippe under all her sayles; but after, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
<span class="sidenote">Condite
head.</span>
we came neere, it discovered it selfe to be a rocke, which
we called <i>Condite-head</i>; for that howsoever a man commeth
with it, it is like to the condite heads about the cittie
of London.</p>

<p>All this coast, so farre as wee discovered, lyeth next of
any thing east and by north, and west and by south. The
land, for that it was discovered in the raigne of Queene
Elizabeth, my soveraigne lady and mistres, and a maiden
Queene, and at my cost and adventure, in a perpetuall
memory of her chastitie, and remembrance of my endeavours,
<span class="sidenote">Hawkins
maiden-land.</span>
I gave it the name of <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> <i>maiden-land</i>.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bedds of oreweed
with
white flowers.</div>

<p>Before a man fall with this land, some twentie or thirtie
leagues, he shall meete with bedds of oreweed, driving to
and fro in that sea, with white flowers growing upon them,
and sometimes farther off; which is a good show and signe
the land is neere, whereof the westermost part lyeth some
threescore leagues from the neerest land of America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our comming
to the
Straites.</div>

<p>With our fayre and large wind, we shaped our course
for the Straites; and the tenth of February we had sight
of land, and it was the head land of the Straites to the
north-wards, which agreed with our height, wherein we
found our selves to be, which was in fifty two degrees
and fortie minutes.</p>

<p>Within a few houres we had the mouth of the
Straites open, which lyeth in fifty-two degrees, and fifty
minutes. It riseth like the North Foreland in Kent,
and is much like the land of Margates. It is not good
to borrow neere the shore, but to give it a fayre birth;
within a few houres we entred the mouth of the Straites,
which is some six leagues broad, and lyeth in fifty-two
degrees, and fifty minutes: doubling the poynt on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
star-board, which is also flat, of a good birth, we opened
a fayre bay, in which we might discry the hull of a ship
beaten upon the beach. It was of the Spanish fleete,
that went to inhabite there, in anno 1582, under the
charge of Pedro Sarmiento,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> who at his returne was taken
prisoner, and brought into England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pedro Sarmiento
buildeth
San-Philip.</div>

<p>In this bay the Spaniards made their principall habitation,
and called it the cittie of Saint Philip, and left it
peopled; but the cold barrennes of the countrie, and the
malice of the Indians, with whom they badly agreed, made
speedie end of them, as also of those whom they left in the
middle of the Straites, three leagues from Cape Froward
to the east-wards, in another habitation.</p>

<p>We continued our course alongst this reach (for all the
Straites is as a river altering his course, sometimes upon
one poynt, sometimes upon another) which is some eight
leagues long, and lyeth west north-west. From this we
entred into a goodly bay, which runneth up into the land
northerly many leagues; and at first entrance a man may
see no other thing, but as it were a maine sea. From the
end of this first reach, you must direct your course west
south-west, and some fourteene or fifteene leagues lyeth one
of the narrowest places of all the Straites; this leadeth
unto another reach, that lyeth west and by north some six
leagues.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Here, in the middle of the reach, the wind tooke us by
the north-west, and so we were forced to anchor some two
or three dayes. In which time, we went a shore with our
boates, and found neere the middle of this reach, on the
star-boord side, a reasonable good place to ground and
trimme a small ship, where it higheth some nine or ten
foote water. Here we saw certaine hogges, but they were
so farre from us, that wee could not discerne if they were
of those of the countrie, or brought by the Spaniards;
these were all the beasts which we saw in all the time we
were in the Straites.</p>

<p>In two tydes we turned through this reach, and so recovered
the ilands of Pengwins; they lye from this reach
<span class="sidenote">Note.</span>
foure leagues southwest and by west. Till you come to
this place, care is to be taken of not comming too neere to
any poynt of the land: for being, for the most part, sandie,
they have sholding off them, and are somewhat dangerous.
<span class="sidenote">The ilands
of Pengwins.</span>
These ilands have beene set forth by some to be three; we
could discover but two: and they are no more, except that
part of the mayne, which lyeth over against them, be an
iland, which carrieth little likelihood, and I cannot determine
it. A man may sayle betwixt the two ilands, or betwixt
them and the land on the larboord side; from which
land to the bigger iland is, as it were, a bridge or ledge, on
which is foure or five fathome water; and to him that
commeth neere it, not knowing thereof, may justly cause
feare; for it showeth to be shold water with his rypling,
like unto a race.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Betwixt the former reach, and these ilands, runneth up a
goodly bay into the country to the north-wards. It causeth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
a great indraught, and above these ilands runneth a great
tide from the mouth of the Straites to these ilands; the
land on the larboord side is low land and sandy, for the
most part, and without doubt, ilands, for it hath many
openings into the sea, and forcible indraughts by them,
and that on the starboord side, is all high mountaynous
land from end to end; but no wood on eyther side. Before
wee passed these ilands, under the lee of the bigger
iland, we anchored, the wind being at north-east, with intent
to refresh ourselves with the fowles of these ilands.
<span class="sidenote">Good provision
in the
Straites.</span>
They are of divers sorts, and in great plentie, as pengwins,
wilde duckes, gulles, and gannets; of the principall we
purposed to make provisions, and those were the pengwins;
which in Welsh, as I have beene enformed, signifieth a
white head. From which derivation, and many other
Welsh denominations given by the Indians, or their predecessors,
some doe inferre that America was first peopled
with Welsh-men; and Motezanna, king, or rather emperour
of Mexico, did recount unto the Spaniards, at their
first comming, that his auncestors came from a farre
countrie, and were white people. Which, conferred with
an auncient cronicle, that I have read many yeares since,
may be conjectured to bee a prince of Wales, who many
hundreth yeares since, with certaine shippes, sayled to the
westwards, with intent to make new discoveries. Hee was
never after heard of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The description
of the
pengwin.</div>

<p>The pengwin is in all proportion like unto a goose, and
hath no feathers, but a certaine doune upon all parts of his
body, and therefore cannot fly, but avayleth himselfe in all
occasions with his feete, running as fast as most men. He
liveth in the sea, and on the land; feedeth on fish in the
sea, and as a goose on the shore upon grasse. They harbour
themselves under the ground in burrowes, as the
connies, and in them hatch their young. All parts of the
iland where they haunted were undermined, save onely one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
valley, which it seemeth they reserved for their foode; for
it was as greene as any medowe in the moneth of Aprill,
with a most fine short grasse. The flesh of these pengwins
is much of the savour of a certaine fowle taken in the
ilands of Lundey and Silley, which wee call puffins: by
the tast it is easily discerned that they feede on fish. They
are very fatt, and in dressing must be flead as the byter;
they are reasonable meate, rosted, baked, or sodden, but
best rosted. We salted some dozen or sixteen hogsheads,
which served us, whilest they lasted, in steede of powdred
beefe.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hunting the
pengwin.</div>

<p>The hunting of them, as we may well terme it, was a
great recreation to my company, and worth the sight, for
in determining to catch them, necessarily was required
good store of people, every one with a cudgell in his hand,
to compasse them round about, to bring them, as it were,
into a ring; if they chanced to breake out, then was the
sport; for the ground being undermined, at unawares it
fayled, and as they ran after them, one fell here, another
there; another, offering to strike at one, lifting up his hand,
sunke upp to the arme-pits in the earth; another, leaping
to avoyd one hole, fell into another. And after the first
slaughter, in seeing us on the shore, they shunned us, and
procured to recover the sea; yea, many times seeing themselves
persecuted, they would tumble downe from such
high rocks and mountaines, as it seemed impossible to escape
with life. Yet as soone as they came to the beach,
presently wee should see them runne into the sea, as though
they had no hurt. Where one goeth, the other followeth,
like sheepe after the bel-wether: but in getting them once
within the ring, close together, few escaped, save such as
by chance hid themselves in the borrowes; and ordinarily
there was no drove which yeelded us not a thousand and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
more: the maner of killing them which the hunters used,
being in a cluster together, was with their cudgels to knocke
them on the head; for though a man gave them many
blowes on the body, they died not; besides, the flesh
bruised is not good to keepe. The massaker ended, presently
they cut off their heads, that they might bleede
well: such as we determined to keepe for store, wee saved
<span class="sidenote">The keeping
for store.</span>
in this maner. First, we split them, and then washed them
well in sea water, then salted them: having layne some
sixe howres in salt, wee put them in presse eight howres,
and the blood being soaked out, we salted them againe
in our other caske, as is the custome to salt beefe; after
this maner they continued good some two moneths, and
served us in stead of beefe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gulls.</div>

<p>The gulls and gannets were not in so great quantitie,
yet we wanted not young gulles to eate all the time of our
stay about these ilands. It was one of the delicatest
foodes that I have eaten in all my life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ducks.</div>

<p>The ducks are different to ours, and nothing so good
meate; yet they may serve for necessitie. They were
many, and had a part of the iland to themselves severall,
which was the highest hill, and more then a musket shott
over.</p>

<p>In all the dayes of my life, I have not seene greater art
and curiositie in creatures voyd of reason, then in the
placing and making of their nestes; all the hill being so
full of them, that the greatest mathematician of the world
could not devise how to place one more then there was
upon the hill, leaving onely one path-way for a fowle to
passe betwixt.</p>

<p>The hill was all levell, as if it had beene smoothed by
art; the nestes made onely of earth, and seeming to be of
the selfe same mould; for the nests and the soyle is all
one, which, with water that they bring in their beakes,
they make into clay, or a certaine dawbe, and after fashion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
them round, as with a compasse. In the bottome they
containe the measure of a foote; in the height about eight
inches; and in the toppe, the same quantitie over; there
they are hollowed in, somewhat deepe, wherein they lay
their eggs, without other prevention. And I am of opinion
that the sunne helpeth them to hatch their young: their
nests are for many yeares, and of one proportion, not one
exceeding another in bignesse, in height, nor circumference;
and in proportionable distance one from another.
In all this hill, nor in any of their nestes, was to be found
a blade of grasse, a straw, a sticke, a feather, a moate, no,
nor the filing of any fowle, but all the nestes and passages
betwixt them, were so smooth and cleane, as if they had
beene newly swept and washed.</p>

<p>All which are motives to prayse and magnifie the universall
Creator, who so wonderfully manifesteth his wisedome,
bountie, and providence in all his creatures, and especially
for his particular love to ingratefull mankinde, for whose
contemplation and service he hath made them all.</p>

<h3>SECTION XXXI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Of seales, or
sea-wolves.</div>

<p>One day, having ended our hunting of pengwins, one of
our mariners walking about the iland, discovered a great
company of seales, or sea-wolves (so called for that they
are in the sea, as the wolves on the land), advising us that
he left them sleeping, with their bellies tosting against the
sunne. Wee provided our selves with staves, and other
weapons, and sought to steale upon them at unawares, to
surprise some of them; and comming down the side of a
hill, wee were not discovered, till we were close upon them:
notwithstanding, their sentinell, before we could approach,
with a great howle waked them: wee got betwixt the sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and some of them, but they shunned us not; for they came
directly upon us; and though we dealt here and there a
blow, yet not a man that withstood them, escaped the
overthrow. They reckon not of a musket shott, a sword
peirceth not their skinne, and to give a blow with a staffe,
is as to smite upon a stone: onely in giving the blow upon
his snowt, presently he falleth downe dead.</p>

<p>After they had recovered the water, they did, as it were,
scorne us, defie us, and daunced before us, untill we had
shot some musket shott through them, and so they appeared
no more.</p>

<p>This fish is like unto a calfe, with foure leggs, but not
above a spanne long: his skinne is hayrie like a calfe; but
these were different to all that ever I have seene, yet I
have seene of them in many parts; for these were greater,
and in their former parts like unto lyons, with shagge
hayre, and mostaches.</p>

<p>They live in the sea, and come to sleepe on the land, and
they ever have one that watcheth, who adviseth them of
any accident.</p>

<p>They are beneficiall to man in their skinnes for many
purposes; in their mostaches for pick-tooths, and in their
fatt to make traine-oyle. This may suffice for the seale,
for that he is well knowne.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXXII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Devises in
sudden
accidents.</div>

<p>One day, our boates being loaden with pengwins, and
comming aboord, a sudden storme tooke them, which together
with the fury of the tyde, put them in such great
danger, that although they threw all their loading into the
sea, yet were they forced to goe before the wind and sea,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
to save their lives. Which we seeing, and considering that
our welfare depended upon their safetie, being impossible
to weigh our anchor, fastned an emptie barrell well pitched
to the end of our cable, in stead of a boy, and letting it
slip, set sayle to succour our boates, which in short space
wee recovered, and after returned to the place where we
ryd before.</p>

<p>The storme ceasing, we used our diligence by all meanes
to seeke our cable and anchor; but the tyde being forcible,
and the weeds (as in many parts of the Straites), so long,
that riding in foureteene fathome water, many times they
streamed three and foure fathomes upon the ryme of the
water; these did so inrole our cable, that we could never
set eye of our boy; and to sweepe for him was but lost
labour, because of the weeds, which put us out of hope to
recover it.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>And so our forcible businesse being ended, leaving instructions
for the <i>Fancie</i> our pynace, according to appointment,
where to find us, we inroled them in many folds of
paper, put them into a barrell of an old musket, and stopped
it in such manner as no wett could enter; then placing
it an end upon one of the highest hills, and the most frequented
of all the iland, wee imbarked our selves, and set
sayle with the wind at north-west, which could serve us but
to the end of that reach, some dozen leagues long, and
some three or foure leagues broad. It lyeth next of any
thing, till you come to Cape Agreda, south-west; from this
Cape to Cape Froward, the coast lyeth west south-west.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The second
peopling
of the
Spaniards.</div>

<p>Some foure leagues betwixt them, was the second peopling
of the Spaniards: and this Cape lyeth in fiftie five
degrees and better.</p>

<p>Thwart Cape Froward, the wind larged with us, and we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
continued our course towards the iland of Elizabeth; which
lyeth from Cape Froward some foureteene leagues west
and by south. This reach is foure or five leagues broad,
and in it are many channells or openings into the sea; for
all the land on the souther part of the Straites are ilands
and broken land; and from the beginning of this reach to
the end of the Straites, high mountaynous land on both
sides, in most parts covered with snow all the yeare long.</p>

<p>Betwixt the iland Elizabeth and the mayne, is the narrowest
passage of all the Straites; it may be some two
musket shott from side to side.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> From this straite to
<span class="sidenote">Elizabeth
bay.</span>
Elizabeth bay is some foure leagues, and the course lyeth
north-west and by west.</p>

<p>This bay is all sandie and cleane ground on the easter
part; but before you come at it, there lyeth a poynt of the
shore a good byrth off, which is dangerous. And in this
reach, as in many parts of the Straites, runneth a quick
and forcible tyde. In the bay it higheth eight or nine
foote water. The norther part of the bay hath foule ground,
and rockes under water: and therefore it is not wholesome
borrowing of the mayne. One of master Thomas Candish
his pynaces, as I have beene enformed, came a-ground upon
one of them, and he was in hazard to have left her there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The river of
Ieronimo.</div>

<p>From Elizabeth bay to the river of Ieronimo, is some
five leagues. The course lyeth west and by north, and
west. Here the wind scanted, and forced us to seek a place
to anchor in. Our boates going alongst the shore, found
a reasonable harbour, which is right against that which
they call river Ieronimo; but it is another channell, by
which a man may disemboake the straite, as by the other
which is accustomed; for with a storme, which tooke us
one night, suddenly we were forced into that opening unwittingly;
but in the morning, seeing our error, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
wind larging, with two or three bourds wee turned out into
the old channell, not daring for want of our pynace to attempt
any new discoverie.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Blanches
bay.</div>

<p>This harbour we called Blanches bay: for that it was
found by William Blanch, one of our masters mates. Here
having moored our shippe, we began to make our provision
of wood and water, whereof was plentie in this bay, and in
all other places from Pengwin ilands, till within a dozen
leagues of the mouth of the Straites.</p>

<p>Now finding our deckes open, with the long lying under
the lyne and on the coast of Brasill, the sunne having
beene in our zenith many times, we calked our ship within
bourd and without, above the decks. And such was the
diligence we used, that at foure dayes end, we had above
threescore pipes of water, and twentie boats of wood stowed
in our ship; no man was idle, nor otherwise busied but in
necessary workes: some in felling and cleaving of wood:
some in carrying of water; some in romaging; some in
washing; others in baking; one in heating of pitch;
another in gathering of mussells; no man was exempted,
but knew at evening whereunto he was to betake himselfe
the morning following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Objection
of wast.</div>

<p>Some man might aske me how we came to have so many
emptie caske in lesse then two moneths; for it seemeth
much that so few men in such short time, and in so long a
voyage, should waste so much?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Answere.</div>

<p>Whereto I answere, that it came not of excessive expence;
for in health we never exceeded our ordinary; but
of a mischance which befell us unknowne in the iland of
Saint James, or Saint Anne, in the coast of Brasill, where
we refreshed our selves, and according to the custome
layd our caske a shore, to trimme it, and after to fill it, the
place being commodious for us. But with the water a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
certaine worm, called <i>broma</i> by the Spaniard, and by us
<i>arters</i>, entred also, which eat it so full of holes that all the
water soaked out, and made much of our caske of small use.
This we remedied the best wee could, and discovered it
long before we came to this place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Warning
against
wormes.</div>

<p>Hereof let others take warning, in no place to have caske
on the shore where it may be avoyded; for it is one of the
provisions which are with greatest care to be preserved in
long voyages, and hardest to be supplyed. These <i>arters</i>
or <i>broma</i>, in all hott countries, enter into the plankes of
shippes, and especially where are rivers of fresh water; for
the common opinion is that they are bred in fresh water,
and with the current of the rivers are brought into the sea;
but experience teacheth that they breed in the great seas
in all hott clymates, especially neere the equinoctiall lyne;
for lying so long under and neere the lyne, and towing a
shalop at our sterne, comming to clense her in Brasill, we
found her all under water covered with these wormes, as
bigge as the little finger of a man, on the outside of the
planke, not fully covered, but halfe the thicknesse of their
bodie, like to a gelly, wrought into the planke as with a
gowdge. And naturall reason, in my judgement, confirmeth
this; for creatures bred and nourished in the sea,
comming into fresh water die; as those actually bred in
ponds or fresh rivers, die presently, if they come into salt
water.</p>

<p>But some man may say, this fayleth in some fishes and
beasts. Which I must confesse to be true; but these
eyther are part terrestryall, and part aquatile, as the mare-maide,
sea-horse, and other of that kind, or have their breeding
in the fresh, and growth or continuall nourishment in
the salt water, as the salmond, and others of that kinde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sheathing
of shippes.</div>

<p>In little time, if the shippe be not sheathed, they put
all in hazard; for they enter in no bigger then a small
Spanish needle, and by little and little their holes become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
ordinarily greater then a mans finger. The thicker the
planke is, the greater he groweth; yea, I have seene many
shippes so eaten, that the most of their plankes under water
have beene like honey combes, and especially those betwixt
wind and water. If they had not beene sheathed, it had
bin impossible that they could have swomme. The entring
of them is hardly to be discerned, the most of them being
small as the head of a pinne.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Which, all such as purpose
long voyages, are to prevent by sheathing their shippes.</p>

<p>And for that I have seene divers manners of sheathing,
for the ignorant I will set them downe which by experience
I have found best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In Spaine
and Portingall.</div>

<p>In Spaine and Portingall, some sheathe their shippes
with lead; which, besides the cost and waight, although
they use the thinnest sheet-lead that I have seene in any
place, yet it is nothing durable, but subject to many
casualties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With double
plankes.</div>

<p>Another manner is used with double plankes, as thicke
without as within, after the manner of furring; which is
little better then that with lead; for, besides his waight,
it dureth little, because the worme in small time passeth
through the one and the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With canvas.</div>

<p>A third manner of sheathing hath beene used amongst
some with fine canvas; which is of small continuance, and
so not to be regarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">With burnt
plankes.</div>

<p>The fourth prevention, which now is most accompted of,
is to burne the utter planke till it come to be in every
place like a cole, and after to pitch it; this is not bad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In China
with varnish.</div>

<p>In China, as I have beene enformed, they use a certaine
betane or varnish, in manner of an artificiall pitch, wherewith
they trim the outside of their shippes. It is said to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
be durable, and of that vertue, as neither worme nor water
peirceth it; neither hath the sunne power against it.</p>

<p>Some have devised a certaine pitch, mingled with glasse
and other ingredients, beaten into powder, with which if
the shippe be pitched, it is said, the worme that toucheth
it dyeth; but I have not heard that it hath beene useful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In England.</div>

<p>But the most approved of all, is the manner of sheathing
used now adayes in England, with thin bourds, halfe inche
thicke; the thinner the better; and elme better then
oake; for it ryveth not, it indureth better under water,
and yeeldeth better to the shippes side.</p>

<p>The invention of the materialles incorporated betwixt the
planke and the sheathing, is that indeed which avayleth;
for without it many plankes were not sufficient to hinder
the entrance of this worme; this manner is thus:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Best manner
of sheathing.</div>

<p>Before the sheathing board is nayled on, upon the inner
side of it they smere it over with tarre halfe a finger thicke
and upon the tarre another halfe finger thicke of hayre,
such as the whitelymers use, and so nayle it on, the nayles
not above a spanne distance one from another; the thicker
they are driven, the better.</p>

<p>Some hold opinion that the tarre killeth the worme;
others, that the worme passing the sheathing, and seeking
a way through, the hayre and the tarre so involve him that
he is choked therewith; which me thinkes is most probable;
this manner of sheathing was invented by my
father, and experience hath taught it to be the best and of
least cost.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>

<h3>SECTION XXXIII.</h3>

<p>Such was the diligence we used for our dispatch to shoot
the Straites, that at foure dayes end, wee had our water
and wood stowed in our shippe, all our copper-worke
finished, and our shippe calked from post to stemme; the
first day in the morning, the wind being fayre, we brought
our selves into the channell, and sayled towards the mouth
of the Straites, praising God; and beginning our course
with little winde, we descryed a fire upon the shore, made
by the Indians for a signe to call us; which seene, I caused
a boat to be man’de, and we rowed ashore, to see what
their meaning was, and approaching neere the shore, wee
saw a cannoa, made fast under a rocke with a wyth, most
artificially made with the rindes of trees, and sowed together
with the finnes of whales; at both ends sharpe, and
turning up, with a greene bough in either end, and ribbes
for strengthening it. After a little while, we might discerne
on the fall of the mountaine (which was full of trees
and shrubbes), two or three Indians naked, which came
out of certaine caves or coates. They spake unto us, and
made divers signes; now poynting to the harbour, out of
which we were come, and then to the mouth of the Straites:
but we understood nothing of their meaning. Yet left they
us with many imaginations, suspecting it might be to advise
us of our pynace, or some other thing of moment;
but for that they were under covert, and might worke us
some treacherie (for all the people of the Straites, and the
land nere them, use all the villany they can towards white
people, taking them for Spaniards, in revenge of the deceit
that nation hath used towards them upon sundry occasions;
as also for that by our stay we could reape nothing but
hinderance of our navigation), wee hasted to our shippe,
and sayled on our course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Long Reach.</div>

<p>From Blanches Bay to long reach, which is some foure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
leagues, the course lyeth west south-west entring into the
long reach, which is the last of the Straits, and longest.
For it is some thirty-two leagues, and the course lyeth
next of any thing north-west.</p>

<p>Before the setting of the sunne, wee had the mouth of
the straits open, and were in great hope the next day to
be in the South sea; but about seaven of the clocke that
night, we saw a great cloud rise out of the north-east,
which began to cast forth great flashes of lightnings, and
sodainely sayling with a fresh gale of wind at north-east,
another more forcible tooke us astayes;<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> which put us in
danger; for all our sayles being a taut, it had like to over-set
our ship, before we could take in our sayles. And
therefore in all such semblances it is great wisedome to
carry a short sayle, or to take in all sayles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note.</div>

<p>Heere we found what the Indians forewarned<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> us of; for
they have great insight in the change of weather, and besides
have secret dealings with the prince of darknesse,
who many times declareth unto them things to come. By
this meanes and other witch-crafts, which he teacheth
them, hee possesseth them, and causeth them to doe what
pleaseth him.</p>

<p>Within halfe an houre it began to thunder and raine,
with so much winde as wee were forced to lye a hull, and
so darke, that we saw nothing but when the lightning
came. This being one of the narrowest reaches of all the
straites, wee were forced, every glasse, to open a little of
our fore-sayle, to cast about our ships head: any man may
conceive if the night seemed long unto us, what desire we
had to see the day. In fine, Phœbus with his beautiful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
face lightned our hemisphere, and rejoyced our heartes
(having driven above twenty-foure leagues in twelve houres,
lying a hull: whereby is to be imagined the force of the
winde and current.)</p>

<p>We set our fore-sayle, and returned to our former harbour;
from whence, within three or foure dayes, we set
sayle againe with a faire winde, which continued with us
till we came within a league of the mouth of the straite;
here the winde tooke us againe contrary, and forced us to
returne againe to our former port; where being ready to
anchor, the wind scanted with us in such maner, as wee
were forced to make a bourd. In which time, the winde
and tide put us so farre to lee-wards, that we could by no
meanes seize it: so we determined to goe to Elizabeth
bay, but before we came at it, the night overtooke us; and
this reach being dangerous and narrow, wee durst neither
hull, nor trye,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> or turne to and againe with a short sayle,
and therefore bare alongst in the middest of the channell,
till we were come into the broad reach, then lay a hull till
the morning.</p>

<p>When we set sayle and ran alongst the coast, seeking
with our boate some place to anchor in. Some foure leagues
to the west-wards of Cape Froward, we found a goodly
<span class="sidenote">English bay.</span>
bay, which wee named English bay; where anchored, we
presently went a shore, and found a goodly river of fresh
water, and an old cannoa broken to peeces, and some two
or three of the houses of the Indians, with peeces of seale
stinking ripe. These houses are made in fashion of an
oven seven or eight foote broad, with boughes of trees, and
covered with other boughes, as our summer houses; and
doubtles do serve them but for the summer time, when
they come to fish, and profit themselves of the sea. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
they retyre themselves in the winter into the country,
where it is more temperate, and yeeldeth better sustenance:
for on the mayne of the Straits, wee neyther saw
beast nor fowle, sea fowle excepted, and a kind of blacke-bird,
and two hoggs towards the beginning of the straites.</p>

<p>Here our ship being well moored, we began to supply
our wood and water that we had spent. Which being a
dayes worke, and the winde during many dayes contrary,
<span class="sidenote">Sloth cause
of imagination.</span>
I endevoured to keepe my people occupied, to divert them
from the imagination which some had conceived, that it
behooved we should returne to Brasill, and winter there,
and so shoot the straites in the spring of the yeare.</p>

<p>So one day, we rowed up the river, with our boat and
light horseman, to discover it and the in-land: where
having spent a good part of the day, and finding shold
water, and many trees fallen thwart it, and little fruite of
our labour, nor any thing worth the noting, we returned.</p>

<p>Another day we trayned our people a-shore, being a
goodly sandie bay; another, we had a hurling of batchelers
against married men. This day we were busied in wrestling,
the other in shooting; so we were never idle, neyther
thought we the time long.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXXIV.</h3>

<p>After we had past here some seven or eight dayes, one
evening, with a flawe from the shore, our ship drove off
into the channell, and before we could get up our anchor,
and set our sayles, we were driven so farre to lee-wards,
that we could not recover into the bay: and night comming
on, with a short sayle, wee beate off and on till the morning.
At the break of the day, conferring with the captaine
and master of my ship what was best to be done, we resolved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
<span class="sidenote">Tobias Cove.</span>
to seeke out Tobias Cove, which lyeth over against
Cape Fryo, on the southern part of the straites, because in
all the reaches of the straites, for the most part, the winde
bloweth trade, and therefore little profit to be made by
turning to winde-wards. And from the ilands of the Pengwins
to the ende of the straites towards the South sea,
there is no anchoring in the channell; and if we should be
put to lee-wards of this cove, we had no succour till we
came to the ilands of Pengwins: and some of our company
which had bin with master Thomas Candish in the voyage
in which he died, and in the same cove many weekes, undertooke
to be our pilots thither. Whereupon we bare up,
being some two leagues thither, having so much winde as
we could scarce lye by it with our course and bonnet of
each; but bearing up before the winde, wee put out our
topsayles and spritsayle, and within a little while the winde
<span class="sidenote">Setting of
the ship
upon a rock.</span>
began to fayle us, and immediately our ship gave a mightie
blow upon a rocke, and stucke fast upon it. And had we
had but the fourth part of the wind which we had in all
the night past, but a moment before we strucke the rocke,
our shippe, doubtlesse, with the blow had broken her selfe
all to peeces. But our provident and most gracious God
which commaundeth wind and sea, watched over us, and
delivered us with his powerfull hand from the unknowne
danger and hidden destruction, that so we might prayse
him for his fatherly bountie and protection, and with the
prophet David say, <i>Except the Lord, keepe the cittie, the
watch-men watch in vaine</i>; for if our God had not kept our
shippe, we had bin all swallowed up alive without helpe or
redemption; and therefore he for his mercies sake grant
that the memoriall of his benefits doe never depart from
before our eyes, and that we may evermore prayse him for
our wonderfull deliverance, and his continuall providence
by day and by night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
company
dismayed.</div>

<p>My company with this accident were much amazed, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
not without just cause. Immediately we used our endevour
to free our selves, and with our boates sounded round about
our shippe, in the mean time assaying<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> our pumpe to know
<span class="sidenote">Diligence to
free it.</span>
if our shippe made more water then her ordinary; we found
nothing increased, and round about our shippe deepe water,
saving under the mid-shippe, for shee was a floate a head
and a sterne: and bearing some fathome before the mayne
mast, and in no other part, was like to be our destruction;
for being ebbing water, the waight in the head and sterne
by fayling of the water, began to open her plankes in the
middest; and upon the upper decke, they were gone one
from another some two fingers, some more; which we
sought to ease and remedie by lightning of her burden, and
throwing into the sea all that came to hand; and laying
out an anchor, we sought to wend her off:<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and such was
the will and force we put to the capsten and tackles fastned
upon the cable, that we plucked the ring of the anchor out
of the eye, but after recovered it, though not serviceable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To the laborious
God
propitious,</div>

<p>All our labour was fruitlesse, till God was pleased that
the flood came, and then we had her off with great joy and
comfort, when finding the current favourable with us, we
stood over to English bay, and fetching it, we anchored there,
having beene some three houres upon the rocke, and with the
blow, as after we saw when our ship was brought aground
in Perico (which is the port of Panama), a great part of her
sheathing was beaten off on both sides in her bulges,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and
some foure foote long and a foote square of her false
stemme, joyning to the keele, wrested a crosse, like unto
a hogges yoake, which hindered her sayling very much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and therefore
praysed.</div>

<p>Here we gave God prayse for our deliverance, and afterward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
procured to supply our wood and water, which we
had throwne overbourd to ease our shippe, which was not
much: that supplyed, it pleased God (who is not ever
angry), to looke upon us with comfort, and to send us a
fayre and large wind, and so we set sayle once againe, in
hope to disemboke the straite; but some dozen leagues
before we came to the mouth of it, the wind changed, and
forced us to seeke out some cove or bay, with our boates to
ride in neere at hand, that we might not be forced to returne
farre backe into the straites.</p>

<p>They sounded a cove some sixteene leagues from the
<span class="sidenote">Crabby cove.</span>
mouth of the straite, which after we called Crabby cove.
It brooked its name well for two causes; the one for that
all the water was full of a small kinde of redd crabbes; the
other, for the crabbed mountaines which over-topped it; a
third, we might adde, for the crabbed entertainement it
gave us. In this cove we anchored, but the wind freshing
in, and three or foure hilles over-topping, like sugar-loaves,
altered and straightned the passage of the wind in such
manner, as forced it downe with such violence in flawes and
furious blusterings, as was like to over-set our shippe at an
anchor, and caused her to drive, and us to weigh; but before
we could weigh it, shee was so neere the rockes, and
the puffes and gusts of wind so sodaine and uncertaine,
sometimes scant, sometimes large, that it forced us to cut
our cable, and yet dangerous if our shippe did not cast the
right way. Here necessitie, not being subject to any law,
forced us to put our selves into the hands of him that was
able to deliver us. We cut our cable and sayle all in one
instant; and God, to shew his power and gratious bountie
towardes us, was pleased that our shippe cast the contrary
way towards the shore, seeming that he with his own hand
did wend her about; for in lesse then her length shee
flatted,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and in all the voyage but at that instant, shee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
flatted with difficultie, for that shee was long, the worst
propertie shee had. On either side we might see the rockes
under us, and were not halfe a shippes length from the
shore, and if she had once touched, it had beene impossible
to have escaped.</p>

<p>Magnified ever be our Lord God, which delivered Ionas out
of the whales belly; and his apostle Peter from being overwhelmed
in the waves; and us from so certaine perishing.</p>

<h3>SECTION XXXV.</h3>

<p>From hence we returned to Blanches bay, and there anchored,
expecting Gods good will and pleasure. Here
beganne the bitternesse of the time to increase, with blustering
and sharpe winds, accompanied with rayne and
sleeting snow, and my people to be dismayde againe, in
manifesting a desire to returne to Brasill, which I would
never consent unto, no, nor so much as to heare of.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Voyages
overthrowne
by pretences.</div>

<p>And all men are to take care that they go not one foote
backe, more then is of mere force; for I have not seene
that any who have yeelded thereunto, but presently they
<span class="sidenote">Edward
Fenton and
master
Thomas
Candish.</span>
have returned home. As in the voyage of master Edward
Fenton, which the Earle of Cumberland set forth, to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
great charge. As also in that of master Thomas Candish,
in which he dyed. Both which pretended to shoote the
Straites of Magelan, and by perswasion of some ignorant
persons, being in good possibilitie, were brought to consent
to returne to Brasill, to winter, and after in the spring to
attempt the passing of the strait againe. None of them
made any abode in Brasill; for presently as soone as they
looked homeward, one with a little blustering wind taketh
occasion to loose company; another complaineth that he
wanteth victuals; another, that his ship is leake; another,
that his masts, sayles, or cordidge fayleth him. So the
willing never want probable reasons to further their pretences.
As I saw once (being but young, and more bold
then experimented), in anno 1582, in a voyage, under the
<span class="sidenote">Master
William
Hawkins.</span>
charge of my uncle, William Hawkins, of Plimouth, Esquire,
in the Indies, at the wester end of the iland of San Iuan
de Portorico. One of the shippes, called the barke <i>Bonner</i>,
being somewhat leake, the captaine complained that she
was not able to endure to England; whereupon a counsell
was called, and his reasons heard and allowed. So it was
concluded that the victuall, munition, and what was serviceable,
should be taken out of her, and her men devided
amongst our other shippes; the hull remaining to be sunke
or burned.</p>

<p>To which I never spake word till I saw it resolved; being
my part rather to learne then to advise. But seeing the
fatall sentence given, and suspecting that the captaine made
the matter worse then it was, rather upon pollicy to come
into another ship, which was better of sayle, then for any
danger they might runne into; with as much reason as
my capacitie could reach unto, I disswaded my unkle privately;
and urged, that seeing wee had profited the adventurers
nothing, wee should endevour to preserve our
principall, especially having men and victualls. But seeing
I prevayled not, I went further, and offered to finde out in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the same shippe and others, so many men, as with me
would be content to carry her home, giving us the third
part of the value of the ship, as shee should be valued at,
at her returne, by foure indifferent persons; and to leave
the vice-admirall which I had under my charge, and to
make her vice-admirall.</p>

<p>Whereupon, it was condescended that we should all goe
aboard the shippe, and that there it should be determined.
The captaine thought himselfe somewhat touched in reputation,
and so would not that further triall should be
made of the matter: saying, that if another man was able
to carry the shippe into England, he would in no case leave
her; neither would he forsake her till shee sunke under
him.</p>

<p>The generall commended him for his resolution, and
thanked me for my offer, tending to the generall good; my
intention being to force those who for gaine could undertake
to carry her home, should also do it gratis, according
to their obligation. Thus, this leake-ship went well into
England; where after shee made many a good voyage in
nine yeares, wherein shee was imployed to and fro; and no
doubt would have served many more, had shee not beene
laid up and not used, falling into the hands of those which
knew not the use of shipping. It were large to recount
the voyages and worthy enterprises, overthrowne by this
pollicie, with the shippes which have thereby gone to
wracke.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXXVI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Danger to
hearken unto
reasons of
returne.</div>

<p>By this and the like experiences, remembring and knowing
that if once I consented to turne but one foote backe, I
should overthrow my voyage, and loose my reputation, I
resolved rather to loose my life, then to give eare to such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
prejudiciall counsell. And so as the weather gave leave,
we entertained our selves the first dayes in necessary
workes, and after in making of coale (for wood was plentifull,
and no man would commence an action of wast against
us), with intent, the wind continuing long contrary, to see
if wee could remedie any of our broken anchors; a forge I
had in my shippe, and of five anchors which we brought
out of England, there remained but one that was serviceable.</p>

<p>In the ilands of Pengwins we lost one; in Crabbe cove,
another; of a third, upon another occasion we broke an
arme; and the fourth, on the rocke had the eye of his ring
broken. This, one day devising with my selfe, I made to
serve, without working him a new. Which when I tooke
first in hand, all men thought it ridiculous; but in fine, we
made it in that manner so serviceable, as till our ship came
to Callaw, which is the port of Lyma, shee scarce used any
other anchor; and when I came from Lyma to Panama,
which was three yeares after, I saw it serve the admirall
in which I came, (a ship of above five hundreth tunnes),
without other art or addition, then what my owne invention
contrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mending
of an unserviceable
anchor.</div>

<p>And for that in the like necessitie or occasion, others
may profit themselves of the industrie, I will recount the
manner of the forging our eye without fire or iron. It was
in this sort.</p>

<p>From the eye of the shanke, about the head of the crosse,
we gave two turnes with a new strong halser, betwixt three
and foure inches, giving a reasonable allowance for that,
which should be the eye, and served in stead of the ring;
then we fastned the two ends of the halser, so as in that part
it was as strong as in any other, and with our capsten
stretched the two byghtes, that every part might bear proportionably;
then armed we all the halser round about with
six yarne synnets, and likewise the shanke of the anchor,
and the head with a smooth matt made of the same synnet:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
this done, with an inch rope, wee woolled the two
byghtes to the shanke, from the crosse to the eye, and that
also which was to serve for the ring, and fitted the stocke
accordingly. This done, those who before derided the invention,
were of opinion, that it would serve for a need;
onely they put one diffcultie, that with the fall or pitch of
the anchor in hard ground, with his waight he would cut
the halser in sunder on the head; for prevention whereof,
we placed a panch, as the mariners terme it, upon the head
of the anchor, with whose softnesse this danger was prevented,
and the anchor past for serviceable.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Entertainement
of time
to avoyd
idlenesse,</div>

<p>Some of our idle time we spent in gathering the barke
and fruite of a certaine tree, which we found in all places
of the straites, where we found trees. This tree carrieth
his fruite in clusters like a hawthorne, but that it is greene,
each berry of the bignesse of a pepper corne, and every of
them containing within foure or five graynes, twise as bigge
as a musterd-seed, which broken, are white within, as the
good pepper, and bite much like it, but hotter. The barke
of this tree hath the savour of all kinde of spices together,
most comfortable to the stomache, and held to be better
then any spice whatsoever. And for that a learned country-man
of ours, Doctor Turner, hath written of it, by the
<span class="sidenote">in gathering
of Winters
barke.</span>
name of <i>Winters barke</i>, what I have said may suffice. The
leafe of this tree is of a whitish greene, and is not unlike
to the aspen leafe.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Other whiles we entertained our selves in gathering of
pearles out of mussels, whereof there are aboundance in all
places, from Cape Froward to the end of the straites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of pearles.</div>

<p>The pearles are but of a bad colour, and small; but it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
may be that in the great mussels, in deeper water, the pearles
are bigger, and of greater value; of the small seed pearle,
there was great quantitie, and the mussels were a great refreshing
unto us; for they were exceeding good, and in
great plentie. And here let me crave pardon if I erre,
seeing I disclaime from being a naturalist, by delivering
my opinion touching the breeding of these pearles, which
I thinke to be of a farre different nature and qualitie to
those found in the East and West Indies, which are found
in oysters; growing in the shell, under the ruff of the
oyster, some say of the dewe, which I hold to be some old
philosophers conceit, for that it cannot bee made probable
how the dew should come into the oyster; and if this were
true, then questionlesse, wee should have them in our
oysters as in those of the East and West Indies; but those
oysters were, by the Creator, made to bring foorth this
rare fruite, all their shels being, to looke to, pearle itselfe.
And the other pearles found in our oysters and mussels, in
divers partes, are ingendred out of the fatnesse of the fish,
in the very substance of the fish; so that in some mussels
have beene found twenty, and thirty, in severall partes of
the fish, and these not perfect in colour, nor clearenes, as
those found in the pearle-oysters, which are ever perfect in
colour and clearenes, like the sunne in his rising, and
therefore called orientall; and not, as is supposed, because
out of the East, for they are as well found in the West, and
no way inferior to those of the East Indies.</p>

<p>Other fish, besides seales and crabbes, like shrimpes,
and one whale, with two or three porpusses, wee saw not
in all the straites. Heere we made also a survay of our
victuals; and opening certaine barrels of oaten meale, wee
found a great part of some of them, as also of our pipes
and fatts<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> of bread, eaten and consumed by the ratts;
doubtlesse, a fift part of my company did not eate so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
as these devoured, as wee found dayly in comming to spend
any of our provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prevention
of ratts.</div>

<p>When I came to the sea, it was not suspected that I had
a ratt in my shippe; but with the bread in caske, which we
transported out of the <i>Hawke</i>, and the going to and againe
of our boates unto our prise, though wee had divers catts
and used other preventions, in a small time they multiplyed
in such a maner as is incredible. It is one of the
generall calamities of all long voyages, and would bee
carefully prevented as much as may bee. For besides that
which they consume of the best victuals, they eate the
sayles; and neither packe nor chest is free from their
<span class="sidenote">The calamities
they
bring to a
ship.</span>
surprises. I have knowne them to make a hole in a pipe
of water, and saying the pumpe, have put all in feare,
doubting least some leake had beene sprung upon the ship.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have heard credible persons report, that
shippes have beene put in danger by them to be sunke, by
a hole made in the bulge.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> All which is easily remedied at
the first, but if once they be somewhat increased, with
difficulty they are to be destroyed. And although I propounded
a reward for every ratt which was taken, and
sought meanes by poyson and other inventions to consume
them; yet their increase being so ordinary and many, wee
were not able to cleare our selves from them.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXXVII.</h3>

<p>At the end of foureteene dayes, one evening, being calme,
and a goodly cleare in the easter-boord, I willed our anchor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
<span class="sidenote">Backwardness
in the
company,</span>
to be weyed,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> and determined to goe into the channell,
whereof ensued a murmuring amongst my company, who
were desirous to see the winde setled before we put out of
the harbour: and in part they had reason, considering how
wee had beene canvased from place to place; yet on the
other side, if wee went not out before night, wee should
loose the whole nights sayling, and all the time which we
should spend in warping out; which would be, doubtles, a
great part of the fore-noone. And although the master
signified unto mee the disposition of my people, and master
Henry Courton (a discreete and vertuous gentlemen, and
my good friend, who in all the voyage was ever an especial
furtherer of all that ever I ordained or proposed), in this
occasion sought to divert me, that all but my selfe were
<span class="sidenote">and the consequences
thereof.</span>
contrarily inclined to that which I thought fit: and though
the common saying be, that it is better to erre with many,
then, all contradicting, alone to hit the right way, yet truth
told mee this proverbe to bee falsely founded; for that it
was not to bee understood, that for erring it is better, but
because it is supposed that by hitting a man shall get emulation
of the contradictors: I encountered it with another,
that sayth, better to be envied then pittied; and well considering,
that being out of the harbour, if the winde took
us contrary, to go to Elizabeth bay was better then to bee
in the port; for a man must of force warpe in and out of
it, and in the time that the shippe could be brought foorth
into the channell, the winde being good, a man might come
from Elizabeth bay to the port, and that there we should
have the wind first, being more to the east-wardes, and in
an open bay, and moreover might set sayle in the night, if
the wind should rise in the evening or in the night;
whereas, in the port, of force, we must waite the light of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
the day. I made my selfe deafe to all murmurings, and
caused my commaund to be put in execution, and, doubtlesse,
it was Gods gracious inspiration, as by the event was
seene; for being gotten into the channell, within an houre,
the winde came good, and we sayled merrily on our voyage;
and by the breake of the day, wee had the mouth of
the straites open, and about foure of the clocke in the
afternoone, wee were thwart of Cape Desire;<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> which is the
westermost part of the land on the souther side of the
straites.</p>

<h3>SECTION XXXVIII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Advertisements
for
commanders.</div>

<p>Here such as have command may behold the many miseries
that befall them, not onely by unexpected accidents and
mischances, but also by contradictions and murmurs of
their owne people, of all calamities the greatest which can
befall a man of discretion and valour, and as difficult to be
overcome; for, to require reason of the common sort, is, as
the philosopher sayth, to seeke counsell of a madd man.
Herein, as I sayd before, they resemble a stiffe necked
horse, who taking the bridle in his teeth, carrieth the rider
whether he pleaseth; so once possessed with any imagination,
no reason is able to convince them. The best remedie
I can propound, is to wish our nation in this poynt to be
well advised, and in especiall, all those that follow the sea,
ever having before their eyes the auncient discipline of our
predecessors; who in conformitie and obedience to their
chiefes and commanders, have beene a mirror to all other
<span class="sidenote">The advantage
of
obedience.</span>
nations, with patience, silence, and suffering, putting in
execution what they have beene commanded, and thereby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
gained the blessings due to such vertues, and leaving to
posteritie perpetuall memories of their glorious victories.
A just recompence for all such as conquer themselves, and
subject their most specious willes to the will of their
superiors.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XXXIX.</h3>

<p>In apprehension whereof at land, I cannot forbeare the
discipline thereof, as at this day, and in the dayes of late
memory, it hath beene practised in the states of Flaunders,
Fraunce, and Brittayne; whereas the Spaniards, Wallons,
Switzers, and other nations, are daily full of murmurings
and mutenies, upon every sleight occasion.</p>

<p>The like I also wish should be imitated by those who
follow the sea; that is, that those who are subject to command,
presume no further then to that which belongeth
unto them: <i>Qui nescit parere, nescit imperare</i>. I speake
this, for that I have sometimes seene unexpert and ignorant
persons, yea, unable to judge of any poynt appertaining to
government, or the guide of a shippe, or company of men,
presuming upon their fine witts, and enamoured of their
owne conceits, contradict and dispute against grave, wise,
and experimented governours: many forward fellowes,
thinking themselves better worthie to command, then to
<span class="sidenote">Advertisements
for
young
servitors.</span>
be commanded. Such persons I advise not to goe, but
where they may command; or els looking before they
leape, to consider well under whom they place themselves,
seeing, for the most part, it is in their choyce to choose a
governour from whom they may expect satisfaction; but
choyce being once made, to resolve with the patient wife
in history; that, that day wherein shee married herselfe to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
an husband, that very day shee had no longer any will
more then the will of her husband: and so he that by sea
or land placeth himselfe to serve in any action, must make
reckoning that the time the journey endureth, he hath no
other will, nor dispose of himselfe, then that of his commander;
for in the governors hand is all power, to recompence
and reward, to punish or forgive.</p>

<p>Likewise those who have charge and command, must
sometimes with patience or sufferance overcome their fury
and misconceits, according to occasions; for it is a great
poynt of wisedome, especially in a generall murmuring,
where the cause is just, or that, as often times it happeneth,
any probable accident may divert the minds of the discontented,
and give hope of remedie, or future event may
produce repentance, to turne, as they say, the deafe eare,
and to winke at that a man seeth. As it is sayde of
Charles the fifth, emperour of Germany, and king of
Spaine; who rounding his campe, one night, disguised,
heard some souldiers rayle and speake evil of him: those
which accompanied him were of opinion, that he should use
some exemplary punishment upon them; not so, sayth he,
for these, now vexed with the miseries they suffer, ease their
hearts with their tongues; but if occasion present it selfe,
they will not sticke to sacrifice their lives for my safetie.
A resolution worthy so prudent a commander, and so
magnanimous a prince.</p>

<p>The like is written of Fabius Maximus, the famous
Romayne, who endured the attribute of coward, with many
other infamies, rather then he would hazard the safetie of
his countrie by rash and incertaine provocations.</p>

by the worthy Earle of Nottingham,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> lord high admirall of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
England; who, in like case, with mature and experimented
knowledge, patiently withstood the instigations of many
couragious and noble captaines, who would have perswaded
him to have laid them aboord; but well he foresaw that
the enemy had an armie aboord, he none; that they exceeded
him in number of shipping, and those greater in
bulke, stronger built, and higher molded, so that they who
with such advantage fought from above, might easily distresse
all opposition below; the slaughter, peradventure,
prooving more fatall then the victory profitable: by being
overthrowne, he might have hazzarded the kingdome;
whereas by the conquest, at most, he could have boasted of
nothing but glorie, and an enemie defeated. But by sufferance,
he alwayes advantaged himselfe of winde and tide;
which was the freedome of our countrey, and securitie of
our navie, with the destruction of theirs, which in the eye
of the ignorant, who judge all things by the externall appearance,
seemed invincible; but truely considered, was
much inferior to ours in all things of substance, as the
event prooved; for we sunke, spoyled, and tooke of them
many, and they diminished of ours but one small pynace,
nor any man of name, save onely captaine Cocke, who
dyed with honour amidst his company. The greatest
dammage, that, as I remember, they caused to any of our
shippes, was to the <i>Swallow</i> of her majestie, which I had
in that action under my charge, with an arrow of fire shott
into her beake-head, which we saw not, because of the
sayle, till it had burned a hole in the nose as bigge as a
mans head; the arrow falling out, and driving alongst
by the shippes side, made us doubt of it, which after we
discovered.

<div class="sidenote">Mutenies not
alwayes to be

<p>In many occasions, notwithstanding, it is most prejudiciall
to dissemble the reprehension and punishment of murmurings
and mutterings, when they carry a likelihood to grow
to a mutenie, seeme to leane to a faction, or that a person
of regard or merite favoureth the intention, or contradicteth
the justice, etc., and others of like qualitie. The prudent
governour is to cut off this hydra’s head in the beginning,
and by prevention to provide remedie with expedition; and
this sometimes with absolute authoritie, although the best
be ever to proceed by counsell, if necessitie and occasion
require not the contrary; for passion many times over-ruleth,
but that which is sentenced and executed by consent,
is justified, although sometimes erronious.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> March

<h3>SECTION XLI.</h3>

<p>From Cape Desire, some foure leagues north-west, lye
foure ilands, which are very small, and the middlemost of
them is of the fashion of a sugar-loafe. We were no
sooner cleare of Cape Desire, and his ledge of rockes, which
lie a great way off into the sea, but the wind took us contrary
by the north-west; and so we stood off into the sea
two dayes and two nights to the west-wards.</p>

<p>In all the straites it ebbeth and floweth more or lesse,
and in many places it higheth very little water; but in
some bayes, where are great indraughts, it higheth eight
or ten foote, and doubtlesse further in, more. If a man be
furnished with wood and water, and the winde good, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
may keepe the mayne sea, and goe round about the straites
to the southwards, and it is the shorter way; for besides
the experience which we made, that all the south part of
the straites is but ilands, many times having the sea open, I
remember that Sir Francis Drake told me, that having shott
the straites, a storme first tooke him at north-west, and after
vered about to the south-west, which continued with him
<span class="sidenote">South part
of the Straites
ilands.</span>
many dayes, with that extremitie, that he could not open
any sayle, and that at the end of the storme, he found
himselfe in fiftie degrees;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> which was sufficient testimony
and proofe, that he was beaten round about the straites:
for the least height of the straites is in fifty two degrees
and fiftie minutes; in which stands the two entrances or
mouths.</p>

<p>And moreover, he said, that standing about, when the
winde changed, he was not well able to double the southermost
iland, and so anchored under the lee of it; and going
a-shore, carried a compasse with him, and seeking out
<span class="sidenote">Sir Francis
Drake imbraceth
the
southermost
point of the
world.</span>
the southermost part of the iland, cast himselfe downe upon
the uttermost poynt, grovelling, and so reached out his
bodie over it. Presently he imbarked, and then recounted
unto his people that he had beene upon the southermost
knowne land in the world, and more farther to the southwards
upon it then any of them, yea, or any man as yet
knowne. These testimonies may suffice for this truth unto
all, but such as are incredulous, and will beleeve nothing
but what they see: for my part, I am of opinion, that the
straite is navigable all the yeare long, although the best
time be in November, December, and January, and then
the winds more favourable, which other times are variable,
as in all narrow seas.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>Being some fiftie leagues a sea-boord the straites, the
winde vering to the west-wards, we cast about to the
north-wards, and lying the coast along, shaped our course
<span class="sidenote">Mocha.</span>
for the iland Mocha. About the fifteenth of April, we
<span class="sidenote">Baldivia.</span>
were thwart of Baldivia, which was then in the hands of
the Spaniards, but since the Indians, in anno 1599, dispossessed
them of it, and the Conception; which are two
of the most principall places they had in that kingdome,
and both ports.</p>

<p>Baldivia had its name of a Spanish captaine so called,
whom afterwards the Indians tooke prisoner, and it is said,
they required of him the reason why he came to molest
them and to take their country from them, having no title
nor right thereunto; he answered, to get gold: which the
barbarous understanding, caused gold to be molten, and
powred down his throat, saying, Gold was thy desire, glut
thee with it.</p>

<p>It standeth in fortie degrees, hath a pleasant river and
navigable, for a ship of good burden may goe as high up
as the cittie; and is a goodly woody country.</p>

<p>Here our beefe beganne to take end, and was then as
good as the day wee departed from England; it was preserved
in pickell, which, though it be more chargeable, yet
the profit payeth the charge, in that it is made more durable,
contrary to the opinion of many, which hold it impossible
that beefe should be kept good passing the equinoctiall
lyne. And of our porke I eate in the house of Don Beltran
de Castro, in Lyma, neere foure yeares old, very good,
preserved after the same manner, notwithstanding it had
lost his pickle long before.</p>

<p>Some degrees before a man come to Baldivia to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
southwards, as Spaniards have told me, lyeth the iland
Chule,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> not easily to be discerned from the mayne; for he
that passeth by it, cannot but thinke it to be the mayne.
It is said to be inhabited by the Spaniards, but badly, yet
rich of gold.</p>

<p>The 19th of April, being Easter-even, we anchored under
the iland Mocha. It lyeth in thirty-nine degrees, it may
be some foure leagues over, and is a high mountainous
hill, but round about the foote thereof, some halfe league
from the sea-shore, it is champion ground, well inhabited,
and manured.</p>

<p>From the straites to this iland, we found that either the
coast is set out more westerly then it is, or that we had a
great current, which put us to the west-wards: for we had
not sight of land in three dayes after. Our reckoning was
to see it, but for that we coasted not the land I cannot determine,
whether it was caused by the current, or lying of
the land. But Spaniards which have sayled alongst it,
have told me that it is a bold and safe coast, and reasonable
sounding off it.</p>

<p>In this iland of Mocha we had communication and contratation<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
with the inhabitants, but with great vigilancie
and care; for they and all the people of Chily are mortall
enemies to the Spaniards, and held us to be of them; and
so esteemed Sir Francis Drake when he was in this iland,
which was the first land also that he touched on this coast.
They used him with so fine a trechery, that they possessed
themselves of all the oares in his boate, saving two, and in
striving to get them also, they slew and hurt all his men:
himselfe, who had fewest wounds, had three, and two of
them in the head. Two of his company which lived long
after, had, the one seaventeene (his name was John Bruer,
who afterward was pilot with master Candish), and the
other above twentie, a negroe-servant to Sir Francis Drake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Trechery of
the Indians.</div>

<p>And with me they used a pollicie, which amongst barbarous
people was not to be imagined, although I wrought
sure; for I suffered none to treate with me nor with my
people with armes. We were armed, and met upon a rock
compassed with water, whether they came to parley and
negotiate. Being in communication with the casiques and
others, many of the Indians came to the heads of our
boates, and some went into them. Certaine of my people
standing to defend the boates with their oares, for that
there went a bad sege, were forced to lay downe their
musketts; which the Indians perceiving, endevoured to fill
the barrells with water, taking it out of the sea in the hollow
of their hands. By chance casting mine eye aside, I
discovered their slynesse, and with a truncheon, which I
had in mine hand, gave the Indians three or foure good
lamskinnes:<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> the casiques seeing it, began to give me satisfaction,
by using rigor towardes those which had beene in
the boates; but I having gotten the refreshing I desired,
and all I could hope from them, would have no further
conversation with them. At our first comming, two of
their casiques, who are their lords or kings, came aboord
our shippe (we leaving one of our company ashore as a
pledge), whom we feasted in good manner; they eat well of
all that was set before them, and dranke better of our
wine: one of them became a little giddie headed, and marvayled
much at our artillery: I caused a peece to be
primed, and after to be shott off, whereat the one started,
but the other made no shew of alteration. After putting
them ashore, loaden with toyes and trifles, which to them
seemed great riches; from all parts of the iland the people
came unto us, bringing all such things as they had, to wit,
sheepe, cockes, etc. (from hennes they would not part), and
<span class="sidenote">Exchanges
of trifles.</span>
divers sorts of fruits and rootes, which they exchanged with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
us for knives, glasses, combes, belles, beades, counters,
pinnes, and other trifles. We saw little demonstration of
gold or silver amongst them, though some they had; and
for that we saw they made estimation of it, we would not
make reckoning of it: but they gave us to understand
that they had it from the mayne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of sheepe.</div>

<p>The sheepe of this iland are great, good, and fatt; I
have not tasted better mutton any where. They were as
ours, and doubtlesse of the breed of those which the
Spaniards brought into the country. Of the sheepe of the
country we could by no meanes procure any one, although
we saw of them, and used meanes to have had of them;
for they esteem them much, as reason willeth, serving them
for many uses; as in another place, God willing, I shall
declare more at large. They have small store of fish.</p>

<p>This iland is scituate in the province of Arawca,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and is
held to be peopled with the most valiant nation in all Chily,
though generally the inhabitants of that kingdome are
very couragious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
apparell,</div>

<p>They are clothed after the manner of antiquitie, all of
woollen; their cassockes made like a sacke, square, with
two holes for the two armes, and one for the head, all open
below, without lining or other art: but of them some are
most curiously wooven, and in colours, and on both sides
alike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and housing.</div>

<p>Their houses are made round, in fashion like unto our
pigeon houses, with a laver<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> in the toppe, to evacuate the
smoake when they make fire.</p>

<p>They brought us a strange kinde of tobacco, made into
little cakes, like pitch, of a bad smell, with holes through
the middle, and so laced many upon a string. They presented
us also with two Spanish letters, thinking us to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Spaniards, which were written by a captaine of a frigate,
that some dayes before had received courtesie at their
hands, and signified the same to the governour; wishing
that the people of the iland would become good subjects to
the king, and that therefore he would receive them into
his favour and protection, and send them some person as
governour; but none of them spake Spanish, and so we
<span class="sidenote">People of
Chily</span>>
dealt with them by signes. The people of this iland, as of
all Chily,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> are of good stature, and well made, and of better
countenance then those Indians which I have seene in many
parts. They are of good understanding, and agilitie, and
<span class="sidenote">Their
weapons.</span>
of great strength. Their weapons are bowes and arrowes,
and macanas: their bowes short and strong, and their arrowes
of a small reede or cane, three quarters of a yard
long, with two feathers, and headed with a flint stone,
which is loose, and hurting, the head remaining in the
wound; some are headed with bone, and some with hard
wood, halfe burnt in the fire. Wee came betwixt the
iland and the mayne. On the south-west part of the iland
lyeth a great ledge of rockes, which are dangerous; and it
is good to bee carefull how to come too neere the iland on
all parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their hate
to the
Spaniards.</div>

<p>Immediately when they discovered us, both upon the
iland and the maine, wee might see them make sundry
great fires, which were to give advise to the rest of the
people to be in a readinesse: for they have continuall and
mortall warre with the Spaniards, and the shippes they
see they beleeve to be their enemies. The citie imperiall
lyeth over against this iland, but eight or tenne leagues
into the countrey: for all the sea coast from Baldivia till
thirty-six degrees, the Indians have now, in a manner, in
their hands free from any Spaniards.

<h3>SECTION XLII.</h3>

<p>Having refreshed our selves well in this iland, for that
little time wee stayed, which was some three dayes, wee
set sayle with great joy, and with a fayre winde sayled
alongst the coast; and some eight leagues to the northwards,
we anchored againe in a goodly bay, and sent our
boates ashore, with desire to speake with some of the
Indians of Arawca, and to see if they would be content to
entertaine amitie, or to chop and change with us. But all
that night and the next morning appeared not one person,
and so wee set sayle againe; and towardes the evening the
winde began to change, and to blow contrary, and that so
much, and the sea to rise so sodainely, that we could not
<span class="sidenote">A cruel
storme.</span>
take in our boates without spoyling of them. This storme
continued with us ten dayes, beyond expectation, for that
wee thought our selves out of the climate of fowle weather;
but truely it was one of the sharpest stormes that ever I
felt to endure so long.</p>

<p>In this storme, one night haling up our boates to free
the water out of them, one of our younkers that went into
them for that purpose, had not that regard, which reason
required, unto our light horseman: for with haling her
<span class="sidenote">The important
losse
of a small
vessell.</span>
up to step into her out of the boate, he split her asunder,
and so we were forced to cut her off; which was no small
heartes grief unto me, for that I knew, and all my company
felt, and many times lamented, the losse of her.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>The storme tooke end, and wee shaped our course for
<span class="sidenote">Saint
Maries.</span>
the iland of Saint Maries, which lyeth in thirtie seaven
degrees and forty minuts; and before you come unto the
iland some two leagues, in the trade way lyeth a rocke,
which, a farre off, seemeth to be a shippe under sayle. This
iland is little and low, but fertill and well peopled, with
Indians and some few Spaniards in it. Some ten leagues
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
<span class="sidenote">Citty of
Conception.</span>
to the north-wards of this iland, lyeth the citty Conception,
with a good port; from this we coasted alongst till wee
came in thirty-three degrees and forty minutes. In which
<span class="sidenote">Iuan
Fernandes.</span>
height lay the ilands of Iuan Fernandes, betwixt threescore
and fourescore leagues from the shore, plentiful of fish, and
good for refreshing. I purposed for many reasons not to
<span class="sidenote">Good to
avoid
discovery.</span>
discover my selfe upon this coast, till wee were past Lyma
(otherwise called Cividad de Los Reyes, for that it was
entered by the Spaniard the day of the three kings); but
my company urged me so farre, that except I should seem
in all things to over-beare them, in not condescending to
that which in the opinion of all, but my selfe, seemed profitable
and best, I could not but yeelde unto, though it
carried a false colour, as the ende prooved, for it was our
perdition. This all my company knoweth to be true,
whereof some are yet living and can give testimonie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilfulnesse
of mariners</div>

<p>But the mariner is ordinarily so carried away with the
desire of pillage, as sometimes for very appearances of small
moment hee looseth his voyage, and many times himselfe.
And so the greedines of spoyle, onely hoped for in shippes
of trade, which goe too and fro in this coast, blinded them
from forecasting the perill whereinto wee exposed our voyage,
in discovering our selves before we past the coast of
Callao, which is the port of Lyma. To be short, wee haled
the coast aboord, and that evening we discovered the port
of Balparizo,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> which serveth the citty of Saint Iago, standing
some twenty leagues into the countrey; when presently
<span class="sidenote">They seize
upon four
ships.</span>
we descried foure shippes at an anchor: whereupon wee
manned and armed our boate, which rowed towards the
shippes: they seeing us turning in, and fearing that which
was, ran a shore with that little they could save, and leaft
us the rest; whereof we were masters in a moment, and
had the rifling of all the storehouses on the shoare.</p>

<p>This night I set a good guard in all the shippes, longing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to see the light of the next morning to put all things in
order; which appearing, I began to survay them, and
found nothing of moment, saving five hundred botozios<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> of
wine, two or three thousand of hennes, and some refreshing
of bread, bacon, dried beefe, waxe, candles, and other
necessaries. The rest of their lading was plankes, spares,
and timber, for Lyma, and the valleyes, which is a rich
trade; for it hath no timber but that which is brought
to it from other places. They had also many packes of
Indian mantles, but of no value unto us, with much tallow,
and manteca de puerco,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> and aboundance of great new
chests, in which wee had thought to be some great masse
of wealth, but opening them, found nothing but apples
therein; all which was good marchandize in Lyma, but to
<span class="sidenote">And the
warehouses.</span>
us of small accompt. The marchandize on shore in their
store-houses was the like, and therefore in the same predicament.
The owners of the shippes gave us to understand
that at a reasonable price they would redeeme their shippes
and loading, which I hearkened unto; and so admitted
certaine persons which might treat of the matter, and concluded
with them for a small price rather then to burne
them, saving for the greatest, which I carryed with me,
more to give satisfaction to my people then for any other
respect; because they would not be perswaded but that
there was much gold hidden in her; otherwise shee would
have yeelded us more then the other three.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They seize
upon another
ship,</div>

<p>Being in this treatie, one morning at the breake of day
came another shippe touring into the harbour, and standing
into the shore, but was becalmed. Against her wee
manned a couple of boates, and tooke her before many
houres. In this shippe we had some good quantitie of
<span class="sidenote">and some
gold.</span>
gold, which shee had gathered in Baldivia, and the Conception,
from whence shee came. Of this shippe was pilot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and part owner, Alonso Perezbueno, whom we kept for
our pilot on this coast; till moved with compassion (for
that he was a man charged with wife and children), we set
him ashore betwixt Santa and Truxillo. Out of this shippe
we had also store of good bacon, and some provision of
bread, hennes, and other victuall. And for that shee had
brought us so good a portion, and her owner continued
with us, the better to animate him to play the honest man
(though we trusted him no further then we saw him, for
we presently discovered him to be a cunning fellow), and
for that his other partner had lost the greatest part of gold,
and seemed to be an honest man, as after he prooved by
his thankfulnesse in Lyma, we gave them the ship and the
greatest part of her loading freely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Light
anchors
brought
from the
North sea.</div>

<p>Here we supplied our want of anchors, though not according
to that which was requisite in regard of the burden
of our shippe; for in the South sea, the greatest anchor
for a shippe of sixe or eight hundreth tunnes, is not a
thousand waight; partly, because it is little subject to
stormes, and partly, because those they had till our comming,
were all brought out of the North sea by land; for
<span class="sidenote">And the first
artillerie.</span>
they make no anchors in those countries. And the first
artillerie they had was also brought over land, which was
small; the carriage and passage from Nombre de Dios, or
Porto Velo to Panama, being most difficult and steepe, up
hill and downe hill, they are all carried upon negroes
backes.</p>

<p>But some years before my imprisonment, they fell to
making of artillery, and, since, they forge anchors also.
<span class="sidenote">Sayles of
cotton cloth.</span>
Wee furnished our shippe also with a shift of sayles of
cotton cloth, which are farre better in that sea then any of
our double sayles; for that in all the navigation of that
sea they have little rayne and few stormes; but where rayne
and stormes are ordinary, they are not good; for with the
wett they grow so stiffe they cannot be handled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLIII.</h3>

<p>I concluded the ransome of the shippes with an auncient
captaine, and of noble blood, who had his daughter there,
ready to be imbarked to go to Lyma, to serve Donia
Teruza de Castro, the viceroyes wife, and sister to Don
Beltran de Castro. Her apparell and his, with divers other
things which they had imbarked in the greatest shippe, we
restored, for the good office he did us, and the confidence
he had of us, comming and going onely upon my word;
for which he was after ever thankefull, and deserved much
more.</p>

<p>Another that treated with me was Captaine Iuan Contreres,
owner of one of the shippes, and of the iland Santa
Maria, in thirtie-seaven degrees and fortie minutes. In
treating of the ransomes, and transporting and lading the
provisions we made choyce of, wee spent some sixe or eight
dayes; at the end whereof, with reputation amongst our
enemies, and a good portion towards our charges, and our
shippe as well stored and victualled as the day we departed
from England, we set sayle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They depart
from Lyma,</div>

<p>The time wee were in this port, I tooke small rest, and
so did the master of our shippe, Hugh Cornish, a most
carefull, orderly, and sufficient man, because we knew our
owne weaknesse; for entring into the harbour, we had but
seaventie five men and boyes, five shippes to guard, and
every one moored by himselfe; which, no doubt, if our
<span class="sidenote">and conceale
their

enemies had knowne, they would have wrought some stratagem
upon us; for the governour of Chily was there on
shore in view of us, an auncient Flanders soldier, and of
experience, wisedome, and valour, called Don Alonso de
Soto Mayor, of the habit of Saint Iago, who was after
captaine generall in Terra Firme, and wrought all the inventions
upon the river of Chagree, and on the shore, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Sir Francis Drake purposed to goe to Panama, in the voyage
wherein he died; as also, at my comming into Spaine,
he was president in Panama, and there, and in Lyma, used
<span class="sidenote">The nobleness
of
Alonso de
Soto.</span>
me with great courtesie, like a noble souldier and liberall
gentleman. He confessed to me after, that he lay in ambush
with three hundreth horse and foote, to see if at any
time wee had landed or neglected our watch, with balsas,
(which is a certaine raffe made of mastes or trees fastened
together), to have attempted something against us. But
<span class="sidenote">The enemy
less dangerous
then the
wine.</span>
the enemy I feared not so much as the wine; which, notwithstanding
all the diligence and prevention I could use
day and night, overthrew many of my people. A foule
fault, because too common amongst sea-men, and deserveth
some rigorous punishment, with severitie to be executed;
for it hath beene, and is daily, the destruction of many
good enterprises, amidst their best hopes. And besides
the ordinary fruites it bringeth forth, of beggery, shame,
and sicknesse, it is a most deadly sinne. A drunkard is
unfit for any government, and if I might be hired with
many thousands, I would not carry with me a man known
to put his felicitie in that vice, instiling it with the name
of good fellowship; which in most well governed common-wealths,
hath beene a sufficient blemish to deprive a man
of office, of honour, and estimation. It wasteth our kingdome
more then is well understood, as well by the infirmities
it causeth, as by the consumption of wealth, to the
impoverishing of us, and the enriching of other kingdomes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish
wines and
burning
feavers unknowne
in
England.</div>

<p>And though I am not old, in comparison of other
auncient men, I can remember Spanish wine rarely to
be found in this kingdome. Then hot burning feavers
were not knowne in England, and men lived many moe
yeares. But since the Spanish sacks have beene common
in our tavernes, which, for conservation, is mingled with
lyme<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> in its making, our nation complaineth of calenturas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
of the stone, the dropsie, and infinite other diseases, not
heard of before this wine came in frequent use, or but very
seldome. To confirme which my beliefe, I have heard one
of our learnedst physitians affirme, that he thought there
died more persons in England of drinking wine and using
hot spices in their meats and drinkes, then of all other
<span class="sidenote">And
consumeth

diseases. Besides there is no yeare in which it wasteth
not two millions of crownes of our substance, by convayance
into forraine countries; which in so well a governed
common-wealth as ours is acknowledged to be through the
whole world, in all other constitutions, in this onely remaineth
to be looked into and remedied. Doubtlesse,
whosoever should be the author of this reformation, would
gaine with God an everlasting reward, and of his country
a statua of gold, for a perpetuall memory of so meritorious
a worke.</p>

<h3>SECTION XLIV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Description
of the bay.</div>

<p>A league or better before a man discover this baye to the
south-wards, lyeth a great rocke, or small iland, neere the
shore; under which, for a need, a man may ride with his
shippe. It is a good marke, and sure signe of the port,
and discovering the bay a man must give a good birth to
the poynt of the harbour; for it hath perilous rockes lying
a good distance off. It neither ebbeth nor floweth in this
port, nor from this till a man come to Guayaquill, which
is three degrees from the equinoctiall lyne to the south-wards.
Let this be considered. It is a good harbour for
all windes that partake not of the north; for it runneth up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
south and by west, and south south-west, but it hath much
fowle ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new devise
for stopping
a leake without
board.</div>

<p>In one of these shippes we found a new devise for the
stopping of a sodaine leake in a shippe under water, without
board, when a man cannot come to it within board; which
eased us of one that we had from the day we departed from
Detford, caused by the touching a-ground of our shippe at
low water, being loaden and in the neap streames, comming
a-ground in the sterne, the force of the tyde caused to cast
thwart, wrested her slegg, and that in such sort, as it made
a continuall leake, though not much. And for that others
may profit themselves of the like, I thinke it good to set
downe the manner of it: which was, taking a round wicker
basket, and to fill it with peeces of a junke or rope, chopped
very small, and of an inch long, and after tozed all as
oacombe;<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> then the basket is to be covered with a nett,
the meshes of it being at the least two inches square, and
after to be tied to a long pike or pole, which is to goe
a crosse the baskets mouth; and putting it under water,
care is to be had to keepe the baskets mouth towardes the
shippes side. If the leake be any thing great, the oacombe
may be somewhat longer, and it carrieth likelihood to doe
good, and seemeth to be better then the stitching of a
bonnet, or any other diligence which as yet I have seene.</p>

<p>Another thing I noted of these shippes, which would be
<span class="sidenote">Spare
rudders.</span>
also used by us; that every shippe carrieth with her a spare
rudder, and they have them to hange and unhange with
great facilitie: and besides, in some parts of the shippe
they have the length, breadth, and proportion of the rudder
marked out, for any mischance that may befall them;
which is a very good prevention.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>Tenne leagues to the north-wards of this harbour, is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
<span class="sidenote">Bay of
Quintera.</span>
bay of Quintera, where is good anchoring, but an open
bay; where master Thomas Candish (for the good he had
done to a Spaniard, in bringing him out of the Straits of
<span class="sidenote"><i>Nota verum
hispanum.</i></span>
Magellan, where, otherwise, he had perished with his
company),<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> was by him betrayed, and a dozen of his men
taken and slaine. But the judgement of God left not his
ingratitude unpunished; for in the fight with us, in the
vice-admirall, he was wounded and maymed in that manner,
as, three yeares after, I saw him begge with crutches, and
in that miserable estate, as he had beene better dead then
alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coquinbo.</div>

<p>From Balparizo wee sailed directly to Coquinbo,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> which
is in thirtie degrees; and comming thwart the place, wee
were becalmed, and had sight of a shippe: but for that
shee was farre off, and night at hand, shee got from us,
and wee having winde, entered the port, thinking to have
had some shipping in it; but we lost our labour: and for
that the towne was halfe a league upp in the countrey,
and wee not manned for any matter of attempt, worthy
prosecution, we made no abode on the shore, but presently
set sayle for the Peru. This is the best harbour that I
have seene in the South sea, it is land-locked for all winds,
and capeable of many shippes; but the ordinary place
where the shippes lade and unlade, and accommodate
themselves, is betwixt a rocke and the mayne on the wester
side, some halfe a league up within the entrance of the
port, which lyeth south and south, and by east and north,
and by west.</p>

<p>In the in-country, directly over the port, is a round
piked hill, like a sugar loafe, and before the entrance on
the southern poynt of the port, comming in out of the sea,
is a great rocke, a good birth from the shore; and these
are the markes of the port as I remember.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Arica in
Chily much
commended.</div>

<p>Being cleere of this port, wee shaped our course for Arica,
and leaft the kingdomes of Chily, one of the best countries
that the sunne shineth on; for it is of a temperate clymate,
and abounding in all things necessary for the use of man,
with infinite rich mines of gold, copper, and sundry other
mettals.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>The poorest houses in it, by report of their inhabitants,
have of their owne store, bread, wine, flesh, and fruite;
which is so plentifull, that of their superfluitie they supply
other partes. Sundry kindes of cattell, as horses, goates,
and oxen, brought thither by the Spaniards, are found in
<span class="sidenote">For all sorts
of fruits.</span>
heardes of thousands, wilde and without owner; besides
those of the countrey, which are common to most partes
of America: in some of which are found the bezar stones,
and those very good and great.</p>

<p>Amongst others, they have little beastes like unto a
squirrell, but that hee is gray; his skinne is the most delicate,
soft, and curious furre that I have seene, and of much
estimation (as is of reason) in the Peru; few of them come
into Spaine, because difficult to be come by; for that the
princes and nobles laie waite for them. They call this beast
<i>chinchilla</i>, and of them they have great abundance.</p>

<p>All fruites of Spaine they have in great plentie, saving
stone fruite and almonds; for in no part of the Indies have
I knowne that plumbes, cherries, or almondes have borne
fruit: but they have certaine little round cocos, as those of
Brasill, of the bignesse of a wall-nut, which is as good as
an almond; besides it hath most of the fruites naturall to
America, of which in another place I shall, God willing,
speake particularly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And plenty
of gold.</div>

<p>The gold they gather is in two manners: the one is
washing the earth in great trayes of wood in many waters.
as the earth washeth away, the gold in the bottome remaineth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
The other is, by force of art to draw it out of
the mynes, in which they finde it. In most partes of the
countrie, the earth is mingled with gold; for the butizias,
in which the wine was, which wee found in Balparizo, had
many sparkes of gold shining in them. Of it the goldsmiths
I carryed with me, for like purposes, made experience.</p>

<p>When Baldivia and Arawca were peaceable, they yeelded
greatest plentie, and the best: but now, their greatest
mynes are in Coquinbo, as also the mines of copper, which
they carry to the Peru, and sell it better cheape then it is
ordinarily sold in Spaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indians
forbid the
search of
gold.</div>

<p>The Indians knowing the end of the Spaniards molestation
to be principally the desire of their riches, have
enacted, that no man, upon paine of death, doe gather any
gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Every
showre a
showre of
gold.</div>

<p>In Coquinbo it rayneth seldome, but every shower of
rayne is a shower of gold unto them; for with the violence
of the water falling from the mountaines, it bringeth from
them the gold; and besides, gives them water to wash it
out, as also for their ingenious to worke; so that ordinarily
every weeke they have processions for rayne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linnen and
woollen
cloth made
in Coquinbo.</div>

<p>In this kingdome they make much linnen and woollen
cloth, and great store of Indian mantles, with which they
furnish other partes; but all is course stuffe. It hath no
silke, nor iron, except in mynes, and those as yet not discovered.
Pewter is well esteemed, and so are fine linnen,
woollen cloth, haberdashers wares, edge tooles, and armes,
or munition.</p>

<p>It hath his governour, and <i>audiencia</i>, with two bishoppes:
the one of Saint Iago, the other of the Imperiall; all under
the vice-roy, <i>audiencia</i>, and primate of Lyma. Saint Iago
is the metropolitan and head of the kingdome, and the
seate of justice, which hath its appellation to Lyma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The valour
of the
Arawcans.</div>

<p>The people are industrious and ingenious, of great
strength, and invincible courage; as in the warres, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
they have susteyned above fortie yeares continually against
the Spaniards, hath beene experienced. For confirmation
whereof, I will alledge onely two proofes of many; the one
was of an Indian captaine taken prisoner by the Spaniards;
and for that he was of name, and knowne to have done his
devoire against them, they cut off his hands, thereby intending
to disenable him to fight any more against them:
but he returning home, desirous to revenge this injury, to
maintaine his libertie, with the reputation of his nation,
and to helpe to banish the Spaniard, with his tongue intreated
and incited them to persevere in their accustomed
valour and reputation; abasing the enemy, and advancing
his nation; condemning their contraries of cowardlinesse,
and confirming it by the crueltie used with him, and others
his companions in their mishaps; shewing them his armes
without hands, and naming his brethren whose halfe feete
they had cut off, because they might be unable to sit on
horsebacke: with force arguing, that if they feared them
not, they would not have used so great inhumanitie; for
feare produceth crueltie, the companion of cowardize.
Thus incouraged he them to fight for their lives, limbes,
and libertie, choosing rather to die an honourable death
fighting, then to live in servitude, as fruitlesse members in
their common-wealth. Thus, using the office of a sergeant
major, and having loaden his two stumpes with bundles of
arrowes, succoured those who in the succeeding battaile
had their store wasted, and changing himselfe from place
to place, animated and encouraged his countri-men with
such comfortable perswasions, as it is reported, and credibly
beleeved, that he did much more good with his words and
presence, without striking a stroake, then a great part of
the armie did with fighting to the utmost.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>The other proofe is, that such of them as fight on horsebacke,
are but slightly armed, for that their armour is a
beasts hide, fitted to their bodie greene, and after worne
till it be dry and hard. He that is best armed, hath him
double; yet any one of them with these armes, and with
his launce, will fight hand to hand with any Spaniard
armed from head to foote. And it is credibly reported, that
an Indian being wounded through the body by a Spaniards
launce, with his owne hands hath crept on upon the
launce, and come to grapple with his adversary, and both
fallen to the ground together. By which is seene their resolution
and invincible courage, and the desire they have
to maintaine their reputation and libertie.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLV.</h3>

<p>Leaving the coast of Chily, and running towards that of
Peru, my company required the third of the gold we had
gotten, which of right belonged unto them; wherein I
desired to give them satisfaction of my just intention, but
not to devide it till we came home, and so perswaded them
with the best reasons I could; alledging the difficultie to
devide the barres, and being parted, how easie it was to be
robbed of them, and that many would play away their portions,
and come home as beggerly as they came out; and
that the shares could not be well made before our returne
to England, because every mans merites could not be discerned
nor rewarded till the end of the voyage. In conclusion,
it was resolved, and agreed, that the things of price,
as gold and silver, should be put into chests with three
keyes, whereof I should have the one, the master another,
and the third, some other person whom they should name.
This they yeelded unto with great difficultie, and not without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
reason; for the bad correspondence used by many captaines
and owners with their companies upon their returne,
defrauding them, or diminishing their rights, hath hatched
many jealousies, and produced many disorders, with the
overthrow of all good discipline and government, as experience
teacheth; for where the souldier and mariner is
unpaide, or defrauded, what service or obedience can be
required at his hands?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Most men
unwilling to
follow covetous
commanders.</div>

<p>The covetous captaine or commander looseth the love of
those under his charge: yea, though he have all the parts
besides required in a perfect commander, yet if he preferre
his private profite before justice, hardly will any man follow
such a leader, especially in our kingdome, where more
absolute authoritie and trust is committed to those who
have charge, then in many other countries.</p>

<p>And therefore in election of chieftaines, care would be
had in examination of this poynt. The shamefull fruites
whereof (found by experience of many yeares, wherein I
have wandred the world), I leave to touch in particular;
because I will not diminish the reputation of any. But
this let me manifest, that there have bin, and are, certaine
<span class="sidenote">The mischiefs
of
corrupt or
scantie
provisions.</span>
persons, who, before they goe to sea, either robbe part of
the provisions, or in the buying, make penurious, unholsome,
and avaritious penny-worths; and the last I hold to
be the least: for they robbe onely the victuallers and
owners; but the others steale from owners, victuallers,
and companie, and are many times the onely overthrowers
of the voyage; for the company thinking themselves to be
stored with foure or sixe moneths victualls, upon survay,
they finde their bread, beefe, or drinke short, yea, perhaps
all, and so are forced to seeke home in time of best hopes
and imployment. This mischiefe is most ordinary in great
actions.</p>

<p>Lastly, some are so cunning, that they not onely make
their voyage by robbing before they goe to sea, but of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
also which commeth home. Such gamsters, a wise man of
our nation resembled to the mill on the river of Thames,
for grinding both with flood and ebbe: so these at their
going out, and comming home, will be sure to robbe all
others of their shares. Although this be a great abuse
amongst us, and but of late dayes practised, and by me
spoken unto by way of animadversion, either in hope of
redresse, or for infliction of punishment; yet I would have
the world know, that in other countries the fault is farre
more insufferable. And the principall cause which I can
finde for it, is that our country imployeth her nobles, or
men of credite in all actions of moment, who rather chuse
to spend wealth and gaine honor, then to gaine riches without
reputation: whereas in Spaine, and other partes, the
advancement of poore men and meane persons by favour
and interest, produceth no other end, but private and particular
respects to enrich themselves; yet the nobilitie
themselves, for the most part, in all occasions pretend rewards
for any small service whatsoever, which with us as
yet is not in use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of detayning
and defrauding
of wages.</div>

<p>But the greatest and most principall robbery of all, in
my opinion, is the defrauding or detaining of the companies
thirdes<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> or wages, accursed by the just God, who forbiddeth
the hyre of the labourer to sleepe with us. To such I
speake as either abuse themselves in detayning it; or else
to such as force the poore man to sell it at vile and low
prices; and lastly, to such as upon fained cavils and sutes,
doe deterre the simple and ignorant sort from their due
prosecutions; which being too much in use amongst us,
hath bred in those that follow the sea a jealousie in all imployments,
and many times causeth mutenies and infinite
inconveniences. A poynt deserving consideration and reformation,
and which with great facilitie may be remedied,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
if upright justice would put it selfe as stickler betwixt the
owners and company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of mariners
by challenge
of pillage.</div>

<p>No lesse worthie of reformation are the generall abuses
of mariners and souldiers, who robbe all they can, under
the colour of pillage, and after make ordinance, cables,
sayles, anchors, and all above deckes, to belong unto them
of right, whether they goe by thirdes or wages: this proceedeth
from those pilfering warres, wherein every gallant
that can arme out a shippe, taketh upon him the name and
office of a captaine, not knowing what to command, nor
what to execute. Such commanders, for the most part,
consort and joyne unto themselves disorderly persons,
pyrates, and ruffians, under the title of men of valour and
experience: they meeting with any prise, make all upon
the deckes theirs of dutie; viz.&mdash;the best peece of ordinance
for the captaine; the second, for the gunner; the
third, for his mate; the best cable and anchor for the
master; the maine topsayle for the botesman:<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> the bonnetts
for the quarter masters; and the rest of the sayles
for the company. The cardes and instruments of the
master, for the master; the surgeans instruments and
chest for the surgean; the carpenters tooles and chest for
the carpenter; and so consequently of each officer, that
answereth the other in the two shippes.</p>

<p>If one happen upon a bag of gold, silver, pearle, or
precious stones, it is held well gotten, provided it be cleanly
stolne, though the shippe and all her loading besides be not
worth so much; little considering the common injury in defrauding
the owners, victuallers, and whole companie: and
forgetting, that if himselfe were a jury-man upon another
in like case, he would adjudge him to the gallows. But I
would advise such novices to know, that our true and
auncient discipline of warre is farre different, and being
understood, is much more better for the generall. Besides it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
is grounded on Gods law (from whence all lawes should be derived),
and true justice, which distributeth to every one that
which to him belongeth of right, and that in due season.</p>

<p>In the time of warre in our country, as also in others
<span class="sidenote">The lawes of
Oleron,
concerning
pillage.</span>
by the lawes of Oleron, which to our auncient sea-men
were fundamental, nothing is allowed for pillage but apparell,
armes, instruments, and other necessaries belonging
to the persons in that shippe which is taken; and these
too when the shippe is gained by dint of sword; with a
proviso, that if any particular pillage exceed the valew of
sixe crownes, it may be redeemed for that valew by the
generall stocke, and sould for the common benefit.</p>

<p>If the prise render it selfe without forcible entry, all in
generall ought to be preserved and sould in masse, and so
equally devided; yea though the shippe be wonne by force
and entry, yet whatsoever belongeth to her of tackling,
sayles, or ordinance, is to bee preserved for the generalitie:
saving a peece of artillery for the captaine, another for
the gunner, and a cable and anchor for the master; which
are the rights due unto them: and these to be delivered when
the shippe is in safety, and in harbour, eyther unloaden or
sould. Which law or custome, well considered, will rise to
be more beneficiall for the owners, victuallers, and
company, then the disorders newly crept in and before
remembred.</p>

<p>For the sayles, cables, anchors, and hull, being sould
every one a part, yeeld not the one halfe which they would
doe if they were sould altogether; besides the excusing of
charges and robberies in the unloading and parting.</p>

<p>In the warres of Fraunce, in the time of queen Mary,
and in other warres, as I have heard of many auncient
captaines, the companie had but the fourth part, and every
man bound to bring with him the armes with which hee
would fight; which in our time I have knowne also used
in Fraunce: and if the company victualed themselves, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
had then the one halfe, and the owners the other halfe for
the shippe, powder, shott, and munition. If any prise were
taken, it was sould by the tunne, shippe and goods, so as
the loading permitted it; that the marchant having bought
the goods, hee might presently transport them whethersoever
he would. By this manner of proceeding, all rested
contented, all being truely paid; for this was just dealing:
if any deserved reward, he was recompensed out of the
generall stocke; if any one had filched or stolne, or committed
offence, hee had likewise his desert. And who once
was knowne to be a disordered person, or a theefe, no man
would receive him into his shippe; whereas, now a dayes
many vaunt themselves of their theftes and disorders: yea
I have seene the common sort of mariners, under the
name of pillage, maintaine and justify their robberies
most insolently, before the queens majesties commissioners,
with arrogant and unseemly termes, for that they would
not condiscend to their unreasonable challenges. The demaunds
being better worth then five hundreth poundes,
which some one pretended to be his; and that of the
choysest marchandize, and most of it robbed out of that
part of the shippe, which they themselves, and all the
world, cannot but confesse to be marchandize.</p>

<p>My opinion is, that such malaperts deserve most justly
to have their spoyle taken from them, or some worse
consideration, and afterwards to be severely punished, in
prevention of greater prejudices, then can by paper be
well declared.</p>

<p>But I must tell you withall, such hath beene the partiallitie
of some commissioners in former times, that upon
information, in lieu of punishment, opinion hath held them
for tall fellowes, when, in truth, they never prove the best
men in difficult occasions. For their mindes are all set
on spoyle, and can bee well contented to suffer their associates
to beare the brunt, whillest they are prolling after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
pillage, the better to gaine and mainetaine the aforesaid
attributes in tavernes and disorderly places.</p>

<p>For the orderly and quiet men I have ever found in all
occasions to bee of best use, most valiant, and of greatest
sufficiency. Yet I condemne none, but those who will be
reputed valiant, and are not: examine the accusation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What ought
to be reputed
pillage.</div>

<p>All what soever is found upon the decke going for marchandize,
is exempted out of the censure of pillage: silks,
linnen, or woollen cloth in whole peeces, apparell, that
goeth to be sold, or other goods whatsoever, though they
be in remnants, manifestly knowne to be carryed for that
end; or being comprehended in the register, or bils of
lading, are not to bee contayned under the name of
pillage.</p>

<p>But as I have sayd of the consort, so can I not but complaine
<span class="sidenote">Against the
disloyalties
of captaines.</span>
of many captaines and governours, who, overcome
with like greedie desire of gaine, condiscend to the
smoothering and suppressing of this auncient discipline,
the clenlier to smother their owne disloyalties, in suffering
these breake-bulks to escape and absent themselves, till
the heate be past and partition made.</p>

<p>Some of these cause the bils of lading to be cast into the
sea, or so to bee hidden that they never appeare. Others
send away their prisoners, who sometimes are more worth
then the shippe and her lading, because they should not
discover their secret stolne treasure; for many times that
<span class="sidenote">Concealment
of much
more value
then the
trading.</span>
which is leaft out of the register or bils of lading, with
purpose to defraud the prince of his customes (in their
conceits held to be excessive), is of much more value then
that which the shippe and lading is worth. Yea I have
knowne shippes worth two hundreth thousand pounds, and
better, cleane swept of their principall riches, nothing but
the bare bulke being leaft unsacked. The like may be
spoken of that which the disorderly mariner and the
souldier termeth pillage; yet all winked at and unpunished,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
although such prizes have beene rendred without stroake
stricken.</p>

<p>This, doubtlesse, cannot but be a hearts greife and discouragement
to all those who vertuously and truely desire
to observe the auncient discipline of our nation, their owne
honours, and the service of their soveraigne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prevention
of undue
pillagings.</div>

<p>But to prevent these unknowne mischiefes, and for his
better discharge, I remember that my father, Sir John Hawkins,
in his instructions, in actions under his charge, had
this particular article: that whosoever rendred or tooke
any shippe, should be bound to exhibite the bils of lading;
to keepe the captaine, master, marchants, and persons of
account, and to bring them to him to be examined, or into
England. If they should bee by any accident seperated
from him, whatsoever was found wanting (the prisoners
being examined), was to bee made good by the captaine and
company which tooke the shippe, and this upon great
punishments. I am witness, and avow that this course did
redownd much to the benefitte of the generall stocke; to
the satisfaction of her majestie and counsell, the justification
of his government, and the content of his followers.</p>

<p>Thus much have I set downe concerning these abuses
and the reformation thereof, for that I have neither seene
them divulged by any with whom I have gone to sea,
neither yet recorded in writing by any mans pen. Let consideration
present them to the eares of the powerfull. But
now to our voyage.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLVI.</h3>

<p>Running alongst the coast till wee came within few leagues
of Arica, nothing happened unto us of extraordinary noveltie
or moment, for we had the brese favourable, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
seldome happeneth in this climate; finding ourselves in
nineteene degrees, wee haled the shore close abourd, purposing
to see if there were any shipping in the road of
<span class="sidenote">Arica.</span>
Arica. It standeth in a great large bay, in eighteene degrees:
and before you come to it, a league to the southwards of
the roade and towne, is a great round hill, higher then the
rest of the land of the bay, neere about the towne; which
wee having discovered, had sight presently of a small
barke, close abourd the shore, becalmed. Manning our
boate, wee tooke her, being loaden with fish, from Moromereno<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>;
which is a goodly head-land, very high, and lyeth
betwixt twenty-foure and twenty-five degrees, and whether
ordinarily some barkes use to goe a fishing every yeare.</p>

<p>In her was a Spaniard and sixe Indians. The Spaniard,
for that hee was neere the shore, swam unto the rockes;
and though wee offered to returne him his barke and fish
(as was our meaning), yet hee refused to accept it, and
made us answere, that hee durst not, for feare least the
<span class="sidenote">The severity
of Spaine.</span>
justice should punish him. In so great subjection are the
poore unto those who have the administration of justice in
those partes, and in most partes of the kingdomes and
countries subject to Spaine. Insomuch, that to heare the
justice to enter in at their doores, is to them destruction and
desolation: for this cause wee carried her alongst with us.</p>

<p>In this meane while wee had sight of another tall shippe,
comming out of the sea, which wee gave chase unto, but
could not fetch upp, beeing too good of sayle for us. Our
small prize and boate standing off unto us, descryed another
shippe, which they chased and tooke also, loaden with fish,
comming from the ilands of Iuan Fernandes.</p>

<p>After wee opened the bay and port of Arica; but seeing
it cleane without shipping, wee haled the coast alongst,
and going aboord to visit the bigger prize, my company
saluted me with a volley of small shot. Amongst them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
one musket brake, and carryed away the hand of him that
shot it, through his owne default, which for that I have
seene to happen many times, I thinke it necessary to note
in this place, that others may take warning by his harme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Over-charging
of
artilleries.</div>

<p>The cause of the muskets breaking, was the charging
with two bullets, the powder being ordayned to carry but
the waight of one, and the musket not to suffer two charges
of powder or shott. By this oversight, the fire is restrayned
with the overplus of the waight of shott, and not being able
to force both of them out, breaketh all to peeces, so to find
a way to its owne center.</p>

<p>And I am of opinion, that it is a great errour to prove
great ordinance, or small shot, with double charges of
powder or shot; my reason is, for that ordinarily the mettall
is proportioned to the waight of the shot which the peece
is to beare, and the powder correspondent to the waight of
the bullet; and this being graunted, I see no reason why
any man should require to prove his peece with more then
is belonging to it of right: for I have seene many goodly
peeces broken with such tryals, being cleane without hony
combes, cracke, flawe, or other perceavable blemish, which
no doubt, with their ordinary allowance, would have served
many yeares. Yea, I have beene certified by men of credit,
that some gunners have taken a glory for breaking many
peeces in the tryall; which is easie to be done by sundry
slights and meanes not fitt to bee published, much lesse to
bee exercised, being prejudiciall to the seller, and chargeable
to the conscience of the practiser; therefore it were
good, this excessive tryall by double charges were cleane
abolished.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> If I should make choyce for my selfe, I would
not willingly, that any peece should come into fort or
shippe, under my charge, which had borne at any time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
more then his ordinary allowance, misdoubting, least,
through the violence of the double charge, the peece may
be crased within, or so forced, as at another occasion with
his ordinary allowance, he might breake in peeces: how
many men so many mindes: for to others this may seem
harsh, for that the contrary custome hath so long time
beene received, and therefore I submit to better experience,
and contradict not but that in a demy culvering, a man
may put two saker or minion shots, or many of smaller
waight: and so in a muskett, two calever shott, or many
smaller, so they exceede not the ordinary waight prescribed
by proportion, arte, and experience.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> These experiments I
hold convenient upon many occasions, yea, and most necessary;
but the vaine custome of double charges, to cause
their peeces thereby to give a better report, I affirme can
produce no other effect but danger, losse, and harme.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLVII.</h3>

<p>Having visited our prises, and finding nothing in them but
fish, we tooke a small portion for our victualing, and gave
the bigger shippe to the Spaniards againe, and the lesser
wee kept, with purpose to make her our pinnas. The
Indians which wee tooke in her, would by no meanes depart
from us, but desired to goe with us to England,
<span class="sidenote">The amity of
the Indians.</span>
saying that the Indian and English were brothers; and in
all places where wee came, they shewed themselves much
affectionated unto us: these were natives of Moremoreno,
and the most brutish of all that ever I had seene; and
except it were in forme of men and speech, they seemed
altogether voyde of that which appertained to reasonable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
men. They were expert swimmers; but after the manner
of spaniels, they dive and abide under water a long time,
and swallow the water of the sea as if it were of a fresh
river. Except a man see them, he would hardly beleeve
how they continue in the sea, as if they were mer-maides,
and the water their naturall element.</p>

<p>Their countrey is most barren, and poore of foode. If
they take a fish alive out of the sea, or meete with a peece
of salted fish, they will devoure it without any dressing, as
savourely as if had beene most curiously sodden or dressed,
all which makes me beleeve that they sustaine themselves
of that which they catch in the sea.</p>

<p>The Spaniards profit themselves of their labour and
travell, and recompense them badly: they are in worse
condition then their slaves, for to those they give sustenance,
house-roome, and clothing, and teach them the
knowledge of God: but the other they use as beastes, to
doe their labour without wages, or care of their bodies or
soules.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLVIII.</h3>

<p>Thwart of Ariquipa,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> the shippe we brought with us from
Balparizo being very leake, and my companie satisfied that
their hope to find any thing of worth in her was vaine,
having searched her from post to stemme, condiscended to
fire her; and the rather to keepe our company together,
which could not well suffer any devision more then of
meere necessity: so by generall accord we eased ourselves
of her, and continued our course alongst the coast, till we
came thwart of the bay of Pisco, which lyeth within
fifteene degrees and fifteene minutes.</p>

<p>Presently after wee were cleare of Cape Saugalean,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
his ilands, wee ranged this bay with our boate and pinnace.
It hath two small ilands in it, but without fruite; and being
becalmed, we anchored two dayes thwart of Chilca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advise given
by sea and
land.</div>

<p>By sea and by land, those of Chyly had given advise to
Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoça, marquis of Cavete, vice-roy
of Peru, resident in Lima, of our being on the coast.
Hee presently with all possible diligence, put out sixe
shippes in warlike order, with well neere two thousand
men, and dispatched them to seeke us, and to fight with
us, under the conduct of Don Beltrian de Castro Ydelaluca,
his wives brother; who departing out of the port of Callao,
turned to wind-ward in sight over the shore, from whence
they had dayly intelligence where wee had beene discovered.
And the next day after our departure out of
Chilca, about the middle of May, at breake of day, wee had
sight each of other, thwart of Cavete, wee being to wind-wards
of the Spanish armado some two leagues, and all with
little or no winde. Our pinnace or prise being furnished
with oares came unto us, out of which we thought to have
taken our men, and so to leave her; but being able to
come unto us at all times, it was held for better to keepe
her till necessity forced us to leave her: and so it was determined
that if we came to likelihood of boording, shee
should lay our boate aboord, and enter all her men, and
from thence to enter our shippe, and so to forsake her.
Although, by the event in that occasion this proved good,
notwithstanding I hold it to bee reproved where the enemie
is farre superiour in multitude and force, and able to come
and bourd if hee list; and that the surest course is to
fortifie the principall the best that may bee, and to cut of
all impediments, where a man is forced to defence: for
that no man is assured to have time answerable to his
purpose and will; and upon doubt whether the others, in
hope to save themselves, will not leave him in greatest extremitie.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION XLIX.</h3>

<p>Wee presently put ourselves in the best order wee could
to fight and to defend ourselves: our prayers we made unto
the Lord God of battails, for his helpe and our deliverance,
putting our selves wholy into his hands. About nine of
the clocke, the brese began to blow, and wee to stand off
into the sea, the Spaniards cheeke by jole with us, ever
getting to the wind-wards upon us; for that the shipping
of the South sea is ever moulded sharpe under water, and
long; all their voyages depending upon turning to wind-wardes,
and the brese blowing ever southerly.</p>

<p>As the sunne began to mount aloft, the wind began to
fresh; which together with the rowling sea that ever
beateth upon this coast, comming out of the westerne-bourd,
caused a chapping sea, wherewith the admirall of
the Spaniards snapt his maine mast asunder, and so began
to lagge a sterne, and with him other two shippes. The
vice-admirall split her maine-sayle, being come within
shott of us upon our broad side, but to lee-wards: the
reare-admirall cracked her maine-yard asunder in the
middest, being a head of us. One of the armado, which
had gotten upon the broad side of us, to wind-wards, durst
not assault us.</p>

<p>With these disgraces<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> upon them, and the hand of God
helping and delivering us, night comming, we began to
consult what course was best to be taken to free our
selves; wherein were divers opinions: some sayd it was
best to stand off to the sea close by all the night; others to
lye it a hull; others to cast about to the shoare-wards two
glasses, and after all the night to stand off to sea close
by. The admirall of the Spaniards, with the other two, were
a sterne of us some foure leagues; the vice-admirall a mile
right to le-wards of us; the reare-admirall in a manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
right a head, some culvering shott; and one upon our
loofe, within shott also. The moone was to rise within two
houres. After much debating, it was concluded that wee
should beare up before the winde, and seeke to escape betwixt
the admirall and the vice-admirall, which wee put in
execution, not knowing of any other disgrace befallen
them, but that of the reare-admirall, till after our surrender,
when they recounted unto us all that had past. In
the morning at breake of day, wee were cleare of all our
enemies, and so shaped our course alongst the coast, for
the bay of Atacames, where we purposed to trim our pinnace,
and to renue our wood and water, and so to depart
upon our voyage with all possible speede.</p>

<p>The Spanish armado returned presently to Callao, which
is the port of Lyma, or of the Citty of the Kings. It
was first named Lyma, and retayneth also that name of
the river, which passeth by the citty called Lyma. The
Spanish armado being entred the port, the people began to
goe ashore, where they were so mocked and scorned by the
women, as scarce any one by day would shew his face:
they reviled them with the name of cowards and golnias,
and craved licence of the vice-roy to bee admitted in their
roomes, and to undertake the surrendry of the English
shippe. I have beene certified for truth, that some of
them affronted their souldiers with daggers and pistols by
their sides.</p>

<p>This wrought such effects in the hearts of the disgraced,
as they vowed eyther to recover their reputation lost, or to
follow us into England; and so with expedition, the vice-roy
commaunded two shippes and a pinnace to be put in
order, and in them placed the chiefe souldiers and marriners
of the rest, and furnished them with victuals and
munition.</p>

<p>The foresayd generall is once againe dispatched to seeke
us; who ranged the coastes and ports, enforming himselfe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
what hee could. Some fiftie leagues to the north-wards of
Lyma, in sight of Mongon, wee tooke a shippe halfe loaden
with wheate, sugar, miell de canas, and cordovan skins:
which for that shee was leake, and sayled badly, and
tackled in such maner as the marriners would not willingly
put themselves into her, wee tooke what was necessary for
our provision and fired her.</p>

<p>Thwart of Truxillo, wee set the companie of her a shore,
with the pilot which we had taken in Balparizo, reserving the
pilot of the burnt shippe, and a Greeke, who chose rather
to continue with us, then to hazard their lives in going
a shore; for that they had departed out of the port of
Santa, which is in eight degrees, being required by the
justice not to weigh anchor before the coast was knowne
to be cleere.</p>

<p>It is a thing worthy to be noted, and almost incredible,
with how few men they use to sayle a shippe in the South
sea; for in this prise, which was above an hundred tuns,
were but eight persons: and in a shippe of three hundreth
tuns, they use not to put above foureteene or fifteene persons;
yea, I have beene credibly enformed, that with
foureteene persons, a shippe of five hundreth tuns hath
beene carried from Guayaquil to Lyma, deepe loaden,
(which is above two hundreth leagues): and are forced ever
to gaine their voyage by turning to wind-wards, which is
the greatest toyle and labour that the marriners have; and
slow sometimes in this voyage foure or five moneths, which
is generall in all the navigations of this coast.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> But the
security from stormes, and certainty of the breze, with the
desire to make their gaine the greater, is the cause that
every man forceth himselfe to the uttermost, to doe the
labour of two men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION L.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The ilands
of Salomon.</div>

<p>In the height of this port of Santa, some seven hundreth
and fiftie leagues to the west-wards, lie the ilands of Salomon,
of late yeares discovered. At my being in Lyma, a
fleete of foure sayle was sent from thence to people them;
which through the emulation and discord that arose
amongst them, being landed and setled in the countrey,
was utterly overthrowne; onely one shippe, with some few
of the people, after much misery, got to the Philippines.
This I came to the knowledge of by a large relation written
from a person of credit, and sent from the Philippines to
Panama. I saw it at my being there, in my voyage towards
Spaine.</p>

<p>Having edged neere the coast to put the Spaniards on
shore, a thicke fogge tooke us, so that wee could not see
the land; but recovering our pinnace and boate, we sayled
on our course, till we came thwart of the port called
Malabrigo: it lyeth in seaven degrees.</p>

<p>In all this coast the currant runneth with great force,
but never keepeth any certaine course, saving that it runneth
alongst the coast, sometimes to the south-wards,
sometimes to the north-wards; which now running to the
north-wards, forced us so farre into the bay, which a point
<span class="sidenote">Punta de
Augussa.</span>
of the land causeth, that they call Punta de Augussa,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> as
thinking to cleere ourselves by roving north-west, wee
could not double this point, making our way north north-west.
Therefore speciall care is ever to bee had of the
current: and doubtlesse, if the providence of Almighty
God had not freede us, wee had runne ashore upon the
land, without seeing or suspecting any such danger. His
name bee ever exalted and magnified for delivering us from
the unknowne daunger, by calming the winde all night:
the sunnes rising manifested unto us our errour and perill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
by discovering unto us the land within two leagues, right
a head. The current had carried us without any wind, at
the least foure leagues; which seene, and the winde beginning
to blow, wee brought our tackes abourd, and in
short time cleared our selves.</p>

<p>Thwart of this point of Augussa, lie two desert ilandes;
they call them Illas de Lobos, for the multitude of seales
which accustome to haunt the shore. In the bigger is
very good harbour, and secure: they lie in sixe degrees and
thirtie minutes.</p>

<p>The next day after, wee lost sight of these ilands, being
thwart of Payta, which lyeth in five degrees; and having
manned our pinnace and boate to search the port, wee had
sight of a tall shippe, which having knowledge of our
being on the coast, and thinking her selfe to be more safe
at sea then in the harbour, put her selfe then under sayle:
to her wee gave chase all that night and the next day, but
in fine she being better of sayle then wee, shee freed her
selfe. Thus being too lee-ward of the harbour and discovered,
we continued our course alongst the shore. That
evening wee were thwart of the river of Guayaquill, which
hath in the mouth of it two ilands: the souther-most and
biggest, called Puma,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> in three degrees; and the other, to
the north-wards, Santa Clara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Puma.</div>

<p>Puma is inhabited, and is the place where they build
their principall shipping; from this river, Lyma and all
the valleys are furnished with timber, for they have none
but that which is brought from hence, or from the kingdome
of Chile. By this river passeth the principall trade
of the kingdome of Quito; it is navigable some leagues
into the land, and hath great abundance of timber.</p>

<p>Those of the Peru, use to ground and trim their shippes
in Puma, or in Panama, and in all other partes they are
forced to carene their shippes. In Puma, it higheth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
falleth fifteene or sixteene foote water, and from this iland
till a man come to Panama, in all the coast it ebbeth and
floweth more or lesse, keeping the ordinary course which
the tides doe in all seas. The water of this river, by experience,
is medicinable, for all aches of the bones, for the
stone, and strangurie: the reason which is given is, because
all the bankes and low lands adjoining to this river,
are replenished with salsaperillia;<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> which lying for the most
part soaking in the water, it participateth of this vertue,
and giveth it this force.</p>

<p>In this river, and all the rivers of this coast, are great
abundance of <i>alagartoes</i>;<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and it is sayd that this exceedeth
the rest; for persons of credit have certified mee, that as
small fishes in other rivers abound in scoales, so the alagartoes
in this. They doe much hurt to the Indians and
Spaniards, and are dreadfull to all whom they catch within
their clutches.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LI.</h3>

<p>Some five or sixe leagues to the north-wards of Puma, is
la Punta de Santa Elena; under which is good anchoring,
cleane ground, and reasonable succour. Being thwart of
this point, wee had sight of a shippe, which wee chased;
but being of better saile then we, and the night comming
on, we lost sight of her, and so anchored under the Isla de
Plata, to recover our pinnace and boate, which had gone
about the other point of the iland, which lyeth in two degrees
and fortie minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Puerto Viejo.</div>

<p>The next day we past in sight of Puerto Viejo, in two
degrees and ten minutes; which lying without shipping,
wee directed our course for Cape Passaos.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> It lyeth directly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
under the equinoctiall lyne; some fourescore leagues to
the west-wards of this cape, lyeth a heape of ilands, the
Spaniards call Illas de Los Galapagos: they are desert
and bear no fruite. From Cape Passaos, wee directed our
course to Cape Saint Francisco, which lyeth in one degree
to the north-wardes of the lyne; and being thwart of it,
wee descried a small shippe, which wee chased all that day
and night; and the next morning our pinnace came to
bourd her; but being a shippe of advise, and full of passengers,
and our ship not able to fetch her up, they
entreated our people badly, and freed themselves; though
the feare they conceived, caused them to cast all the dispatches
of the king, as also of particulars, into the sea,
with a great part of their loading, to bee lighter and better
of sayle; for the shippes of the South sea loade themselves
like lighters, or sand barges, presuming upon the securitie
from stormes.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LII.</h3>

<p>Being out of hope to fetch up this shippe, wee stood in with
the cape, where the land beginneth to trend about to the
east-wards. The cape is high land, and all covered over
with trees, and so is the land over the cape; and all
the coast, from this cape to Panama, is full of wood, from
the Straites of Magelan to this Cape of San Francisco. In
all the coast from head-land to head-land, the courses lye
betwixt the north, and north and by west, and sometimes
more westerly, and that but seldome. It is a bold coast,
and subject to little foule weather or alteration of windes,
for the brese, which is the sowtherly wind, bloweth continually
from Balparizo to Cape San Francisco, except it
be a great chance.</p>

<p>Trending about the cape, wee haled in east north-east,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
to fetch the bay of Atacames, which lyeth some seaven
leagues from the cape. In the mid-way, some three leagues
from the shore, lyeth a banke of sand, whereof a man must
have a care; for in some parts of it, there is but little
water.</p>

<p>The tenth of June, wee came to an anchor in the bay of
Atacames, which on the wester part hath a round hammock.
It seemeth an iland, and in high springes I judge
that the sea goeth round about it. To the east-wards it
hath a high sandie cliffe, and in the middest of the bay, a
faire birth from the shore, lyeth a bigge black rocke above
water: from this rocke to the sandie cliffe, is a drowned
marsh ground, caused by his lownesse; and a great river,
which is broad, but of no depth.</p>

<p>Manning our boate, and running to the shore, we found
presently, in the westerne bight of the bay, a deepe river,
whose indraught was so great that we could not benefit
our selves of it, being brackish, except at low water, which
hindred our dispatch; yet in five dayes, wee filled all our
emptie caske, supplied our want of wood, and grounded
and put in order our pinnace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They dismisse
their
Indians.</div>

<p>Here, for that our Indians served us to no other use but
to consume our victuals, we eased our selves of them; gave
them hookes and lines which they craved, and some bread
for a few dayes, and replanted them in a farre better countrey
then their owne, which fell out luckely for the
Spaniards of the shippe which wee chased thwart of Cape
San Francisco; for victuals growing short with her, having
many mouthes, shee was forced to put a shore fiftie of her
passengers neere the cape; whereof more than the one
halfe dyed with famine and continual wading through
rivers and waters: the rest, by chance, meeting with the
Indians which wee had put a shore, with their fishing,
guide, and industry, were refreshed, susteyned, and brought
to habitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LIII.</h3>

<p>Our necessary busines being ended, wee purposed the
fifteenth day of May, in the morning, to set sayle; but
the foureteenth in the evening, we had sight of a shippe,
some three leagues to sea-wards; and through the importunitie
of my captaine and companie, I condiscended
that our pinnas should give her chase: which I should not
have done, for it was our destruction. I gave them precise
order, that if they stood not in againe at night, they
should seeke mee at Cape San Francisco, for the next
morning I purposed to set sayle without delay. And so
seeing that our pinnas slowed her comming, at nine of the
clocke in the morning wee weyed our anchors, and stood
for the cape, where wee beate off and on two dayes; and
our pinnas not appearing, wee stood againe into the bay,
where wee descried her turning in without a maine mast,
which standing off to the sea close by, with much winde, and
a chapping sea, bearing a taunt-sayle, where a little was too
much (being to small purpose), sodainely they bare it by
the bourd; and standing in with the shore, the winde, or
rather God blinding them for our punishment, they knewe
not the land; and making themselves to bee to wind-wards
of the bay, bare up, and were put into the bay of San
Mathew. It is a goodly harbour, and hath a great fresh
river, which higheth fifteene or sixteene foote water, and is
a good countrey, and well peopled with Indians: they have
store of gold and emeralds. Heere the Spaniards from
Guayaquill made an habitation, whilst I was prisoner in
Lyma, by the Indians consent; but after, not able to suffer
the insolencies of their guests, and being a people of stomacke
and presumption, they suffered themselves to bee
<span class="sidenote">The Indians
led by a
Molato.</span>
perswaded and led by a Molato. This leader many yeares
before had fled unto them from the Spaniards: him they had
long time held in reputation of their captaine generall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
and was admitted also unto a chiefe office by the Spaniardes,
to gaine him unto them.</p>

<p>But now the Indians uniting themselves together, presuming
that by the helpe of this Molato, they should
force the Spaniards out of the countrey, put their resolution
into execution, drove their enemies into the woods,
and slue as many as they could lay hands on; some they
killed, few escaped with life; and those who had that good
happe, suffered extreame misery before they came to Quito,
the place of neerest habitation of Spaniards.</p>

<p>To this bay, assoone as our people in the pinnas saw their
errour, they brought their tackes abourd, and turned and
tyded it up, as they could. Assoone as we came to anchor,
I procured to remedie that was amisse; in two daies wee
dispatched all we had to doe, and the next morning wee resolved
to set sayle, and to leave the coast of Peru and Quito.</p>

<p>The day appearing, we began to weigh our anchors, and
being a pike, ready to cut sayle, one out of the toppe descryed
<span class="sidenote">Spanish
Armado.</span>
the Spanish armado, comming about the cape; which
by the course it kept, presently gave us to understand who
they were: though my company, as is the custome of sea-men,
made them to be the fleete bound for Panama, loaden
with treasure, and importuned that in all hast we should
cut sayle and stand with them; which I contradicted, for
that I was assured, that no shipping would stirre upon the
coast till they had securitie of our departure (except some
armado that might be sent to seeke us), and that it was
not the time of the yeare to carry the treasure to Panama.
And besides, in riding still at an anchor, they ever came
neerer unto us; for they stood directly with us, and wee
kept the weather gage; where if we had put our selves
under sayle, the ebbe in hand, wee should have given them
the advantage, which we had in our power, by reason of
the point of the bay. And being the armado, as it was,
we gained time to fit ourselves, the better to fight. And
truly (as before, to a stiffe-necked horse), so now againe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
I cannot but resemble the condition of the mariner to any
thing better, then to the current of a furious river, repressed
by force or art, which neverthelesse ceaseth not to
seeke a way to overthrow both fence and banke: even so
the common sort of sea-men, apprehending a conceite in
their imaginations, neither experiment, knowledge, examples,
reasons, nor authority, can alter and remoove them
from their conceited opinions. In this extremitie, with
reason I laboured to convince them, and to contradict
their pretences: but they altogether without reason, or
against reason, breake out, some into vaunting and bragging,
some into reproaches of want of courage, others into
wishings that they had never come out of their countrey,
if we should refuse to fight with two shippes whatsoever.
<span class="sidenote">The unadvised
courage
of the
multitude.</span>
And to mend the matter, the gunner, for his part, assured
me that with the first tire<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> of shott, he would lay the one of
them in the sods: and our pinnace, that she would take
the other to taske. One promised that he would cut
downe the mayne yard; another that he would take their
flagge; and all in generall shewed a great desire to come
to tryall with the enemy. To some I turned the deafe eare,
with others I dissembled, and armed myselfe with patience
(having no other defence nor remedie for that occasion),
soothing and animating them to the execution of what they
promised, and perswaded them to have a little sufferance,
seeing they gained time and advantage by it.</p>

<p>And to give them better satisfaction, I condiscended that
our captaine, with a competent number of men, should with
our pinnace goe to discover them; with order that they
should not engage themselves in that manner as they might
not be able to come unto us, or we to succour them. In all
these divisions and opinions, our master, Hugh Dormish,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
who was a most sufficient man for government and valour,
and well saw the errors of the multitude, used his office as
became him; and so did all those of best understanding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>In short space our pinnace discovered what they were,
and casting about to returne unto us, the vice-admirall, being
next her, began with her chace to salute her with three or
foure peeces of artillery, and so continued chasing her and
gunning at her. My company seeing this, now began to
change humour; and I then to encourage and perswade
them to performe the execution of their promises and
vaunts of valour, which they had but even now protested,
and given assurance of by their proferres and forwardnesse.</p>

<p>And that we might have sea-roome to fight, we presently
weighed anchor, and stood off to sea with all our sayles, in
hope to get the weather gage of our contraries. But the
winde scanting with us, and larging with them, we were
<span class="sidenote">The beginning
of the
fight.</span>
forced to lee-ward. And the admirall weathering us,
came rome<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> upon us: which being within musket shott, we
hayled first with our noise of trumpets, then with our
waytes, and after with our artilery: which they answered
with artilery, two for one. For they had double the ordinance
we had, and almost tenne men for one. Immediately
they came shoring<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> abourd of us, upon our lee quarter, contrary
to our expectation, and the custome of men of warre.
<span class="sidenote">The inexperience
of the
Spaniards.</span>
And doubtlesse, had our gunner beene the man he was
reputed to be, and as the world sould him to me, shee had
received great hurt by that manner of bourding. But
<span class="sidenote">And carelesnesse
of the
English.</span>
contrary to all expectation, our stearne peeces were unprimed,
and so were all those which we had to lee-ward,
save halfe one in the quarter, which discharged, wrought
that effect in our contraries as that they had five or sixe
foote water in hold, before they suspected it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How farre a
commander
is to trust
his officers.</div>

<p>Hereby all men are to take warning by me, not to trust
any man in such extremities, when he himselfe may see it
done: and comming to fight, let the chieftaine himselfe be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
sure to have all his artilery in a readinesse upon all occasions.
This was my oversight, this my overthrow. For
I and all my company had that satisfaction of the sufficiencie
and the care of our gunner, as not any one of us ever
imagined there would be any defect found in him. For
my part, I with the rest of our officers, occupied our selves
in cleering our deckes, laceing our nettings, making of
bulwarkes, arming our toppes, fitting our wast-cloathes,
tallowing our pikes, slinging our yards, doubling our
sheetes, and tackes, placing and ordering our people, and
procuring that they should be well fitted and provided of
all things; leaving the artilery, and other instruments of
fire, to the gunners dispose and order, with the rest
of his mates and adherents; which, as I said, was part
of our perdition. For bearing me ever in hand, that he
had five hundred cartreges in a readinesse, within one
houres fight we were forced to occupie three persons onely
in making and filling cartreges; and of five hundred elles
of canvas and other cloth given him for that purpose, at
sundry times, not one yard was to be found. For this we
have no excuse, and therefore could not avoyd the danger,
to charge and discharge with the ladell, especially in so
hotte a fight.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> And comming now to put in execution the
sinking of the shippe, as he promised, he seemed a man
without life or soule. So the admirall comming close unto
us, I myselfe, and the master of our shippe, were forced to
play the gunners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deceit of the
gunner, and
his extreme
carelesnesse,
and suspitious
disloyalty.</div>

<p>Those instruments of fire wherein he made me to spend
excessively, before our going to sea, now appeared not;
neither the brasse balles of artificiall fire, to be shott with
slurbowes (whereof I had six bowes, and two hundreth bals,
and which are of great account and service, either by sea
or land); he had stowed them in such manner, though in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
double barrels, as the salt water had spoyled them all; so
that comming to use them, not one was serviceable. Some
of our company had in him suspition to be more friend to
the Spaniards then to us; for that he had served some
yeares in the <i>Tercera</i>, as gunner, and that he did all this
of purpose. Few of our peeces were cleere, when we came
to use them, and some had the shott first put in, and after
the powder. Besides, after our surrendry, it was laid to
his charge, that he should say, he had a brother that served
the king in the <i>Peru</i>, and that he thought he was in the
armado; and how he would not for all the world he should
be slaine. Whether this were true or no, I know not; but
I am sure all in generall gave him an ill report, and that he
in whose hands the chiefe execution of the whole fight
consisted, executed nothing as was promised and expected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Admonitions
for commanders.</div>

<p>The griefe and remembrance of which oversights once
againe inforceth me to admonish all captaines and commanders
hereby to take advice, now and then to survey
their officers and store-roomes, the oftener the better;
that so their defects and wants may be supplied in time:
never relying too much upon the vulgar report, nor giving
too much credite to smooth tongues and boasting companions.
But to performe this taske, it is requisite that
all captaines and commanders were such, and so experimented
in all offices, that they might be able as well to controule
as to examine all manner of errors in officers. For
the government at sea hardly suffereth a head without exquisite
experience. The deficiency whereof hath occasioned
<span class="sidenote">Who to be
accounted a
true mariner.</span>
some ancient sea-men to straighten the attribute of marriner
in such sort, as that it ought not to be given but to
the man who is able to build his shippe, to fit and provide
her of all things necessary, and after to carry her about
the world: the residue to be but saylers. Hereby giving
us to understand, that though it is not expedient that he
<span class="sidenote">His knowledge
for
materialls.</span>
should be an axe-carpenter, to hewe, cut, frame, and
mould each timber piece, yet that he should know the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
parts and peeces of the shippe, the value of the timber,
planke, and yron-worke, so to be able as well to build in
proportion, as to procure all materialls at a just price.
And againe, though it be not expected that he should sowe
the sayles, arme the shrowds, and put the tackling over
head, yet is it requisite that he should knowe how to cut
his sayles, what length is competent to every roape, and to
be of sufficiency to reprehend and reforme those who erre
<span class="sidenote">For
provisions.</span>
and doe amisse. In providing his shippe with victualls,
munition, and necessaries, of force it must be expected
that he be able to make his estimate, and (that once provided
and perfected), in season, and with expedition to see
it loden and stowed commodiously, with care and proportion.
After that, he is to order the spending thereof, that
in nothing he be defrauded at home; and at sea, ever to
know how much is spent, and what remaineth unspent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For navigation.</div>

<p>In the art of navigation, he is bound also to know so
much as to be able to give directions to the pilote and
master, and consequently to all the rest of inferiour officers.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LIV.</h3>

<p>My meaning is not that the captaine or governour should
be tyed to the actuall toyle, or to intermeddle with all
offices, for that were to binde him to impossibilities, to
diminish and abase his authoritie, and to deprive the other
officers of their esteemes, and of that that belongeth unto
them, which were a great absurditie: but my opinion is,
that he should be more then superficially instructed and
practised in the imployments. Yea, I am verily perswaded,
that the more absolute authoritie any commander giveth
to his under officers, being worthy of it, the sweeter is the
command, and the more respected and beloved the commander.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Office of
the master.</div>

<p>For in matter of guide and disposing of the saylers, with
the tackling of the shippe, and the workes which belong
thereunto, within bourd and without, all is to be committed
to the masters charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Office of
the pilot.</div>

<p>The pilote is to looke carefully to the sterridge of the
shippe; to be watchfull in taking the heights of sunne and
starre; to note the way of his shippe, with the augmenting
and lessening of the winde, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bote
swaine.</div>

<p>The boateswayne is to see his shippe kept cleane; his
mastes, yards and tacklings well coated, matted and armed;
his shroudes and stayes well set; his sayles repayred, and
sufficiently prevented with martnets, blayles, and caskettes;
his boate fitted with sayle, oares, thougts, tholes danyd,
windles and rother; his anchors well boyed, safely stopped
and secured, with the rest to him appertaining.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The steward.</div>

<p>The steward is to see the preservation of vittayles and
necessaries committed unto his charge; and by measure
and weight to deliver the portions appointed, and with discretion
and good tearmes to give satisfaction to all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The carpenter.</div>

<p>The carpenter is to view the mastes and yards, the sides
of the shippe, her deckes, and cabines, her pumpes, and
boate; and moreover to occupie him selfe in the most
forceible workes, except he be otherwise commanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gunner.</div>

<p>The gunner is to care for the britching and tackling of
his artilery; the fitting of his shott, tampkins, coynes,
crones,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> and lin-stockes, etc. To be provident in working
his fire workes; in making and filling his cartreges; in
accommodating his ladles, sponges, and other necessaries;
in sifting and drying his powder; in cleaning the armes,
munition, and such like workes, intrusted unto him.</p>

<p>In this manner every officer, in his office, ought to be
an absolute commander, yet readie in obedience and love,
to sacrifice his will to his superiors command. This cannot
but cause unitie; and unitie cannot but purchase a happie
issue to dutifull travelles.

<div class="sidenote">Directions

<p>Lastly, except it be in urgent and precise cases, the head
should never direct his command to any but the officers,

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LVI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Why the
Spanish
admirall
came to
lee-wards.</div>

<p>The reason why the admirall came to lee-wardes, as after I
understood, was for that her artillery being very long, and
the wind fresh, bearing a taunt sayle to fetch us up, and
to keepe us company, they could not use their ordinance to
the weather of us, but lay shaking in the wind: and doubtlesse
it is most proper for shippes to have short ordinance,
except in the sterne or chase. The reasons are many:
viz.&mdash;easier charging, ease of the shippes side, better traversing,
and mounting; yea, greater security of the artillery,
and consequently of the ship. For the longer the
peece is, the greater is the retention of the fire, and so the
torment and danger of the peece the greater.</p>

<p>But here will be contradiction by many, that dare avouch
that longer peeces are to be preferred; for that they burne
their powder better, and carrie the shott further, and so
necessarily of better execution; whereas the short artillery
many times spend much of their powder without burning,
and workes thereby the slenderer effect.</p>

<p>To which I answere, that for land service, fortes, or
castles, the long peeces are to bee preferred: but for shipping,
the shorter are much more serviceable. And the
powder in them, being such as it ought, will be all fiered
long before the shott can come forth; and to reach farre
in fights at sea, is to little effect. For he that purposeth
to annoy his enemie, must not shoot at randome, nor at
point blanke, if hee purpose to accomplish with his devoire,
nether must hee spend his shott nor powder, but where a
pot-gun may reach his contrary; how much the neerer, so
much the better: and this duely executed, the short artillery
will worke its effect as well as the long; otherwise,
neither short nor long are of much importance: but here
my meaning is not to approve the overshort peeces, devised
by some persons, which at every shott they make, daunce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
out of their carriages, but those of indifferent length, and
which keepe the meane, betwixt seaven and eight foote.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Intertainement

Spaniards.</div>

<p>The entertainement wee gave unto our contraries, being
otherwise then was expected, they fell off, and ranged a
head, having broken in peeces all our gallerie; and presently
they cast about upon us, and being able to keepe us
company, with their fighting sayles, lay a weather of us,
ordinarily within musket shott; playing continually with
them and their great artillery; which we endured, and
answered as we could.</p>

<p>Our pinnace engaged herselfe so farre, as that before shee

and came to this preferment by his long and painful service;
who though he had the title of generall by sea, I
thinke it was rather of courtesie then by pattent; and for
that hee had beene many yeares generall of the South sea,
for the carriage and waftage of the silver from Lyma to
Panama. He seemed to bee an assistant, to supply that
with his counsell, advice, and experience, whereof Don
Beltran had never made tryall (for hee commanded not
absolutely, but with the confirmation of Don Beltran), for
the Spaniards never give absolute authoritie to more then
one. A custome that hath beene, and is approoved in all
empires, kingdomes, common-wealths, and armies, rightly
disciplined: the mixture hath been seldome seene to prosper,
as will manifestly appeare, if we consider the issue of
all actions and journeys committed to the government of
two, or more generally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two chieftains
joyned
in commission,
dangerous.</div>

<p>The famous victory of Hannibal against the Romane
consuls Paulus Emillius and Terrentius Varro, was attributed
to their equality of government. The unhappie
overthrowe given by the Turke Amurate, to the Christian
princes, in the journey of Nicapolis, is held to have proceeded
from the difference betwixt the heads, every one
leaning to his owne opinion. The overthrow in recoverie
of the Holy land, undertaken by king Richard of England,
and king Philip of France, sprang from the like differences
and dissentions. The victory of the emperour Charles the
Fifth, against the Protestant princes of Germanie, is imputed
to their distractures arising from parity in command.
If we looke into our owne actions, committed to the charge
of two generals, the effects and fruits which they have
brought forth, for the most part, will be found to be little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
better: yea, most of them, through emulation, envie, and
pride, overthrowne, and brought to nought; though to
cover their confusions, there have never beene wanting
cloakes and colours. The most approoved writers reproove,
and call it a monster with two heads, and not without
reason. For if the monarchy be generally approoved, for
strongest, soundest, and most perfect, and most sufficient
to sustaine it selfe; and the democracie and aristocracie
utterly reprooved, as weake, feeble, and subject to innovations
and infirmities; it cannot be but errour, confusion,
and imperfection, to differ or dissent from it. For where
the supreame government is divided betwixt two or more,
the authoritie is diminished, and so looseth his true force;
as a fagget of stickes, whose bond being broken, the entire
strength is easily dissolved: but all under correction.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, in their armadoes by sea, imitate the
discipline, order, and officers, which are in an army by
land, and divide themselves into three bodies; to wit,
souldiers, marriners, and gunners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The souldier.</div>

<p>Their souldiers ward and watch, and their officers in
every shippe round, as if they were on the shoare; this is
the only taske they undergoe, except cleaning their armes,
<span class="sidenote">The gunner.</span>
wherein they are not over curious. The gunners are exempted
from all labour and care, except about the artillery.</p>

<p>And these are either Almaynes, Flemmings, or strangers;
for the Spaniards are but indifferently practised in this
<span class="sidenote">The
marriner.</span>
art. The marriners are but as slaves to the rest, to moyle,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
and to toyle day and night; and those but few and bad,
and not suffered to sleepe or harbour themselves under the
deckes. For in faire or fowle weather, in stormes, sunne,
or raine, they must passe voyde of covert or succour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Officers in
a shippe
of war.
Captaine of
the shippe.
Captaine of
the souldiers.</div>

<p>There is ordinarily in every shippe of warre, a captaine,
whose charge is as that of our masters with us, and also a
captaine of the souldiers, who commandeth the captaine of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the shippe, the souldiers, gunners, and marriners in her;
yea, though there be divers captaines, with their companies
in one shippe (which is usuall amongst them), yet one
hath the supreme authoritie, and the residue are at his
<span class="sidenote"><i>Mastros de
campo</i>, &amp;c.</span>
ordering and disposing. They have their <i>mastros de campo</i>,
seargeant, master, generall (or captaine) of the artillery,
with their alfere major, and all other officers, as in a
campe.</p>

<p>If they come to fight with another armado, they order
themselves as in a battell by land; in a vanguard, rereward,
maine battell, and wings, etc. In every particular
shippe the souldiers are all set upon the deckes; their forecastle
they account their head front, or vanguard of their
company; that abaft the mast, the rereward; and the
wayste the mayne battell; wherein they place their principall
force, and on which they principally relye, which
they call their <i>placa de armas</i>, or place of armes: which
taken, their hope is lost.</p>

<p>The gunners fight not but with their great artillery: the
marriners attend only to the tackling of the shippe and
handling of the sayles, and are unarmed, and subject to
all misfortunes; not permitted to shelter themselves, but
to be still aloft, whether it be necessary or needlesse. So
ordinarily, those which first fayle, are the marriners and
saylers, of which they have greatest neede. They use few
close fights or fire-workes; and all this proceedeth, as I
judge, of errour in placing land captaines for governours
and commanders by sea; where they seldome understand
what is to be done or commanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prying of

<p>Some that have beene our prisoners, have perfitted<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
themselves of that they have seene amongst us; and others
disguised under colour of treaties, for ransoming of prisoners,

they have beene imployed in, they seeke to imitate our
government and reformed discipline at sea: which, doubtlesse,
is the best and most proper that is at this day knowne
or practised in the whole world, if the execution be answerable
to that which is knowne and received for true and
good amongst us.</p>

<p>In the captaine (for so the Spaniards call their admirall)
was an English gunner, who to gaine grace with those
under whom hee served, preferred himselfe, and offered to
sinke our shippe with the first shott he made: who, by the
Spaniards relation, being travesing of a peece in the bowe,
to make his shott, had his head carryed away with the first
or second shott made out of our shippe. It slew also two
or three of those which stood next him.</p>

<p>Which may be a good and gentle warning for all those
who mooved either with covetousnesse, or with desire of
revenge, or in hope of worldly promotion, or other respect
whatsoever, doe willingly and voluntarily serve the enemie
against their owne nation: <i>nulla causa insta videri potest,
adversus patriam arma capiendi</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ends of

<p>And if we consider the end of those who have thus erred,
wee shall finde them, for the most part, lamentable and

their lives in beggery, voyde of reputation.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LIX.</h3>

<p>The fight continued so hott on both sides, that the artillery
and muskets never ceased playing. Our contraries, towards
the evening, determined the third time to lay us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
abourd, with resolution to take us or to hazard all. The
order they set downe for the execution hereof, was, that
the captaine (or admirall) should bring himselfe uppon our
weather bowe, and so fall abourd of us, upon our broad
side: and that the vice-admirall should lay his admirall
abourd uppon his weather quarter, and so enter his men
into her; that from her they might enter us, or doe as
occasion should minister.</p>

<p>The captaine of the vice-admirall being more hardy then
considerate, and presuming with his shippe and company
to get the price and chiefe honour, wayted not the time to
put in execution the direction given, but presently came
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniards
pay
deerely for
their rashnesse.</span>
abourd to wind-wards uppon our broad side. Which,
doubtlesse, was the great and especiall providence of
Almightie God, for the discouraging of our enemies, and
animating of us. For although shee was as long, or rather
longer then our shippe, being rarely<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> built, and utterly
without fights or defences; what with our muskets, and
what with our fire-works, wee cleered her decks in a moment,
so that scarce any person appeared. And doubtlesse
if we had entred but a dozen men, we might have enforced
them to have rendred unto us, or taken her; but our
company being few, and the principall of them slaine or
hurt, we durst not, neither was it wisedome, to adventure
the separation of those which remained: and so held that
for the best and soundest resolution, to keepe our forces
together in defence of our owne.</p>

<p>The vice-admirall seeing himselfe in great distresse,
called to his admirall for succour; who presently laid him
abourd, and entred a hundreth of his men, and so cleered
themselves of us.</p>

<p>In this bourding, the vice-admirall had at the least
thirtie and sixe men hurt and slaine; and amongst them
his pilote shot through the body, so as he died presently.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
<span class="sidenote">And take a
new resolution.</span>
And the admirall also received some losse, which wrought
in them a new resolution, onely with their artillery to
batter us; and so with time to force us to surrender, or to
sinke us; which they put in execution: and placing themselves
within a musket shott of our weather quarter, and
sometimes on our broad side, lay continually beating upon
us without intermission; which was, doubtlesse, the best
and securest determination they could take; for they
being rare<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> shippes, and without any manner of close fights,
in boarding with us, their men were all open unto us, and
we under covert and shelter. For on all parts our shippe
was musket free, and the great artillery of force must cease
on either side (the shippes being once grapled together),
except we resolved to sacrifice our selves together in fire.
For it is impossible, if the great ordinance play (the shippes
being bourded), but that they must set fire on the shippe
they shoote at; and then no surety can be had to free
himselfe, as experience daily confirmeth. For a peece of
artillery most properly resembleth a thunderclap, which
breaking upwards, or on the side, hurteth not; for that
the fire hath scope to dispence it selfe without finding resistance,
till the violence which forceth it taketh end, and
so it mounts to its center: but breaking downe right
or stooping downwards, and finding resistance or impediment,
before the violence that forceth it take end, being
so subtill and penetrable a substance, passeth and pierceth
so wonderfully, as it leaveth the effect of his execution in
all points answerable to his levell and nighnesse. For if
the clouds be nigh the earth (as some are higher, some
lower), and breake down-wards, the violence wherewith the
fire breaketh out is such, and of so strange an execution,
that men have beene found dead without any outward signe
in their flesh, and yet all their bones burnt to dust. So
the blade of the sword hath beene found broken all to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
peeces in the scabard, and the scabard whole without
blemish: and a cristall glasse all shivered in peeces, his
cover and case remaining sound; which commeth to passe
for that in the flesh, in the scabard, and in the case, the
fire being so subtile of nature, findeth easie passage without
resistance; but the bones, the blade, the cristall, being
of substance more solide, maketh greater resistance, and
so the fire with the more fury worketh the more his execution
in its objects. As was seene in the Spanish admirall
(or captaine), after my imprisonment, crossing from
Panama to Cape San Francisco, a rayo (for so the Spaniards
call a thunder-clappe), brake over our shippe, killed one
in the fore-toppe, astonished either two or three in the
shroudes, and split the mast in strange manner: where it
entred it could hardly be descerned, but where it came
forth, it drave out a great splinter before it; and the man
slaine, was cleane in a manner without signe or token of
hurt, although all his bones turned to powder; and those
who lived and recovered, had all their bodies blacke, as
burnt with fire: which plainly declareth and confirmeth
that above said, and may serve to judge in such occasions
of persons hurt with thunder; for if they complaine of
their bones, and have little signe of the fire, their hazard
of death is the greater, then when the fire hath left greater
impressions outward. The fire out of a cloude worketh
like effect, only where it leveleth directly, as experience
daily teacheth; killing those who are opposite, hurting
those who are neere, and only terrifying those who are
further distant.</p>

<p>In like manner the peece of ordinance hurteth not those
which stand aside, nor those which stand a slope from his
mouth, but those alone which stand directly against the
true point of his levell: though sometimes the winde of
the shott overthroweth one, and the splinters (being accidents),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
mayne<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and hurt others. But principally where the
peece doth resemble the thunder clappe, as when the ships
are bourded: for then, although the artillery be discharged
without shott, the fury of the fire, and his piercing nature
is such, as it entreth by the seames, and all parts of the
ships sides, and meeting with so fit matter as pitch, tarre,
ocombe, and sometimes with powder, presently converteth
all into flames.</p>

<p>For avoyding whereof, as also the danger and damage
which may come by pikes and other inventions of fire, and
if any shippe be oppressed with many shippes at once, and
subject by them to be bourded; I hold it a good course to
strike his fore and mayne yards close to his decke, and to
fight with sprit-saile and myson, and top-sayles loose: so
shall he be able to hinder them from oppressing him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pollicies
to avoid
bourdings.</div>

<p>Some have thought it a good pollicy to launce out some
ends of mastes or yards by the ports or other parts: but
this is to be used in the greater shippes; for in the lesser,
though they be never so strong, the waight of the bigger
will beate out the opposite sides and doe hurt, and make
great spoyle in the lesser. And in bourding, ordinarily
the lesser shippe hath all the harme which the one shippe
can doe unto the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes
concerning
ships of
trade.</div>

<p>Here is offered to speake of a point much canvassed
amongst carpenters and sea captaines, diversly mainetained
but yet undetermined: that is, whether the race<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> or loftie
built shippe bee best for the merchant, and those which
imploy themselves in trading? I am of opinion that the race
shippe is most convenient; yet so as that every perfect
shippe ought to have two deckes, for the better strengthening
of her; the better succouring of her people; the better
preserving of her merchandize and victuall; and for her
greater safetie from sea and stormes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Concerning
the prince
his shippes.</div>

<p>But for the princes shippes, and such as are imployed
continually in the warres, to be built loftie I hold very
necessary for many reasons. First for majestie and terrour
of the enemy; secondly, for harbouring of many men;
thirdly, for accommodating more men to fight; fourthly,
for placing and using more artillery; fiftly, for better
strengthening and securing of the shippe; sixtly, for over-topping
and subjecting the enemy; seventhly, for greater
safeguard and defence of the ship and company. For it is
plaine, that the ship with three deckes, or with two and a
halfe, shewes more pomp than another of her burthen with
a decke and a halfe, or two deckes, and breedeth greater
terror to the enemy, discovering herselfe to be a more
powerfull ship, as she is, then the other; which being indeed
a ship of force, seemeth to be but a barke, and with
her low building hideth her burthen. And who doubteth
that a decke and a halfe cannot harbour that proportion of
men, that two deckes, and two deckes and a halfe can
accommodate to fight; nor carry the artillery so plentifully,
nor so commodiously. Neither can the ship be so
strong with a decke and a halfe as with two deckes; nor
with two, as with three; nor carry her masts so taunt; nor
spread so great a clue; nor contrive so many fightes, to
answer one another for defence and offence. And the
advantage the one hath of the other, experience daily
teacheth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All ships of
warre are
not to be
low built.</div>

<p>In the great expedition of eightie eight, did not the
<i>Elizabeth Jonas</i>, the <i>Triumph</i>, and the <i>Beare</i>, shew greater
majestie then the <i>Arke Royall</i> and the <i>Victorie</i>, being of
equall burthens? did they not cause greater regard in the
enemy? did they not harbour and accommodate more men,
and much better? did they not beare more artillery? And
if they had come to boord with the Spanish high-charged
ships, it is not to be doubted but they would have mustred
themselves better, then those which could not with their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
prowesse nor props, have reached to their wastes. The
strength of the one cannot be compared with the strength of
the other: but in bourding, it goeth not so much in the
strength, as in weight and greatnesse. For the greater
ship that bourdeth with the lesser, with her mastes, her
yardes, her tacklings, her anchors, her ordinance, and with
her sides, bruseth and beateth the lesser to peeces, although
the lesser be farre stronger according to proportion.</p>

<p>The <i>Foresight</i> of his Majesties, and the <i>Daintie</i>, were
shippes in their proportions farre more stronger then the
carake which was taken by them and their consorts, anno
92: for she had in a manner no strong building nor binding,
and the others were strengthened and bound as art
was able to affoord; and yet both bourding with her, were
so brused, broken, and badly handled, as they had like to
have sunke by her side, though bourding with advantage
to weather-wards of her. But what would have become of
them if she should have had the wind of them, and have
come aboord to wind-ward of them? In small time, no
doubt, she would have beaten them under water.</p>

<p>Anno 90, in the fleet under the charge of Sir John
Hawkins, my father, comming from the south-wards, the
<i>Hope</i>, of his Majesties, gave chase to a French ship, thinking
her to be a Spaniard. She thought to have freed
her selfe by her sailing, and so would not availe, but endured
the shooting of many peeces, and forced the <i>Hope</i>
to lay her abourd; of which issued that mischiefe which
before I spake off. For in a moment the French ship had
all her mastes, yards, and sailes in the sea, and with great
difficultie the <i>Hope</i> could free herselfe from sinking her.</p>

<p>In the self-same voyage, neere the ilands of Flores and
Corvo, the <i>Rainbow</i> and the <i>Foresight</i> came foule one of
another; the <i>Rainbow</i>, being the greater shippe, left the
<i>Foresight</i> much torne; and if God had not beene pleased
to seperate them, the lesser, doubtlesse, had sunke in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
sea; but in these incounters they received little or no hurt.
The boording of the <i>Rainbow</i> and <i>Foresight</i>, as I was
enformed, proceeded of the obstinacie and self will of the
captaine or master of the <i>Foresight</i>, who would not set
sayle in time, to give sea roome to the other, comming
<span class="sidenote">Particular
respects
must give
place to the
generall.</span>
driving upon her, for that she was more flotie.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> This pride
I have seene many times to be the cause of great hurt, and
is worthy of severe punishment: for being all of one company,
and bound every one to helpe and further the good
of the other, as members of one body, there ought to be no
strayning of courtesie; but all are bound to suppress
emulation and particular respect, in seeking the generall
good of all, yea, of every particular more ingeniously then
that of his owne.</p>

<p>But in equitie and reason, the le-ward shippe ought ever
to give way to the weather most, in hulling or trying,
without any exception. First, for that shee advantageth
the other in hulling or trying; which is manifest, for that
shee to wind-wards drives upon her to le-wards. Secondly,
for that the windermost shippe, by opening her sayle, may
be upon the other before shee be looked for, either for
want of steeridge, not being under way, or by the rowling
of the sea, some one sea casting the shippe more to le-wards
then ten others. And thirdly, for that the windermost
shippe being neere, and setting sayle, is in possibilitie
to take away the winde from her to le-wards comming
within danger. And this by way of argument, for a hull
and under-sayle in stormes and fayre weather, in harbour,
or at sea.</p>

<p>Humanitie and courtesie are ever commendable and
beneficiall to all, whereas arrogancie and ambition are ever
accompanied with shame, losse, and repentance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrogancy
of a Spanish
generall.</div>

<p>And though in many examples, touching this point, I
have beene an eye witnesse, yet I will record but one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
which I saw in the river of Civill,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> at my comming out of
the Indies amongst the galleons loaden with silver. For
their wafting, the king sent to the Tercera, eight new
galleons, under the charge of Villa Viciosa; who entring
the barre of Saint Luar joyntly, the shippes loaden with
silver, anchored in the middest of the river in deeper water,
and the wafters on either side, neere the shoare. The admirall
of the wafters rode close by the galleon in which I
was, and had moored her selfe in that manner, as her
streame, cable, and anchor, overlayed our land-most. And
winding up with the first of the flood, shee her selfe in one
of her cables, which together with the great currant of
the ebbe, and force of the winde which blewe fresh, caused
her to drive, and to dragge home her anchors; and with
that which overlay ours, to cause us to doe the like.
Whereupon, on both sides was crying out to veere cable:
we, for our parts, had lost all our cables in the Terceras,
saving those which were a-ground, and those very short,
and vered to the better end. The admirall strained courtesie,
thinking the other, though loaden with silver, bound
to let slippe one, so to give him way; and the generall
standing in his gallery, saw the danger which both shippes
ranne into, being in a manner bourd and bourd, and
driving upon the point of the shoare: yet he commanded
to hold fast, and not to vere cable, till he was required and
commanded in the kings name, by the captaine of our
shippe; protesting, the damage which should ensue thereof
to the king and merchants, to runne upon the admirals
accompt; and that in his shippe he had no other cable
but those which were aground, and that they had vered
as much as they could: which the generall knowing, and
at last better considering, willed to vere his cable end for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
end, and so, with some difficultie and dispute, the punto
was remedied; which if he had done at first, he had prevented
all other danger, inconvenience, and dispute, by only
weighing of his cable and anchor after the gust was past, and
letting it fall in a place more commodious: whereas, his
vaine glory, stoutnesse, and selfe-will, had put in great
perill two of the kings shippes, and in them above two
millions of treasure. And it may be, if he had beene one
of the ignorant generalls, such as are sometimes imployed,
whereas he was one of best experience, I doubt not, but
they would have stood so much upon their puntos,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> as rather
then they would have consented to vere theyr cables (for
that it seemed a diminution of authoritie), they would
rather have suffered all to goe to wracke, without discerning
the danger and damage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubts and
objections
resolved.</div>

<p>But to returne to my former point of advantage, which
the greater shippe hath of the lesser, I would have it to
be understood according to occasion, and to be understood
of ships of warre with ships of warre; it being no part of
my meaning to mainetaine that a small man of warre should
<span class="sidenote">And the duty
of a small
ship against
a greater.</span>
not bourd with a great shippe which goeth in trade. For I
know, that the war-like shippe that seeketh, is not only
bound to bourd with a greater, but were shee sure to hazard
her selfe, shee ought to bourd where any possibility of surprising
may be hoped for. Witnesse the Biscaine shippes
of five hundreth tunnes, taken by shippes of lesse then a
hundreth. Such were those which were taken by captaine
George Reymond, and captaine Greenfield Halse; both
wonne by bourding and force of armes. And did not
Markes Berry, with a shippe of foure-score tunnes, by
bourding and dent of sword, take a shippe which came
from the Nova Hispania, of neere foure hundreth tunnes?
To recount all such as have beene in this sort taken by our
countreymen, as also those of great worth they have lost,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
for not hazarding the bourding, were never to make an
end. Yet discretion is ever to be used; for a man that in a
small barke goeth to warre-fare, is not bound to bourd
with a carake, nor with a shippe which he seeth provided
with artillery and other preventions far above his possibilitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vain-glory of
the Spanish.</div>

<p>The Spaniards confesse us to advantage them in our
shipping, and attribute all our victories to that which is
but a masse of dead wood, were it not managed and ordered
by art and experience; affirming, that if we came to handie
strokes and bourding, they should goe farre beyond us,
which to any person of reasonable understanding, cannot
but seeme most vaine-glorious; for we leave not to bourd
with them upon occasion, when otherwise we cannot force
them to surrender: but I conclude it to be great errour,
and want of discretion in any man, to put himselfe, his
shippe, and company in perill, being able otherwise to vanquish
his enemy.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>This imagination, so vaine and so voyde of ground, hath
growne from the ignorance of some of our common sort of
marriners and vulgar people, which have beene prisoners
in Spaine: who being examined and asked, why her Majesties
shippes in occasions bourd not, have answered and
enformed that it is the expresse order of her Majestie and
counsell, in no case to hazard her shippes by bourding;
yea, I have knowne some captaines of our owne (to colour
their faint proceedings), have averred as much, which is
nothing so. For in the houre that her majestie or counsell
committeth the charge of any of her shippes to any person,
it is left to his discretion to bourd or not to bourd, as the
reason of service requireth. And therefore let no man
hereafter pretend ignorance, nor for this vanitie leave to
doe his duty, or that which is most probable to redound to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the honour and service of his prince and countrey, and to
the damage of his enemy. For in case he excuse himselfe
with this allegation, it cannot but redound to his condemnation
and disreputation. And I assure all men, that in
any reasonable equalitie of shipping, we cannot desire
greater advantage, then we have of the Spaniards by bourding.
The reasons why, I hold it not convenient to discourse
in particular; but experience and tract of time, with that
which I have seen amongst them, hath taught me this
knowledge; and those who have seene their discipline, and
ours, cannot but testifie the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Courses for
artillery after
bourding.</div>

<p>Againe, all that which hath beene spoken of the danger of
the artillery in bourding, it is not to be wrested nor interpreted,
to cut of utterly the use of all artillery after bourding,
but rather I hold nothing more convenient in shippes
of warre, then fowlers and great bases in the cage workes,
and murderers in the cobridge heads; for that their execution
and speedie charging and discharging, is of great
moment.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disuses of
engines of
antiquitie.</div>

<p>Many I know have left the use of them, and of sundry
other preventions, as of sherehookes, stones in their toppes,
and arming them; pikebolts in their wales, and divers
other engines of antiquitie. But upon what inducement,
I cannot relate, unlesse it be because they never knew
their effects and benefit; and may no doubt be used without
the inconveniences before mentioned in great ordinance.
As also such may be the occasion, that without
danger some of the great artillery may be used, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
with great effect, which is in the discretion of the commanders
and their gunners, as hath beene formerly seene,
and daily is experimented. In the <i>Revenge</i> of her Majesties
good experience was made, who sunke two of the Spanish
armado lying abourd her.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXI.</h3>

<p>In these bourdings and skirmishes, divers of our men were
slaine, and many hurt, and myselfe amongst them received
sixe wounds; one of them in the necke very perillous;
another through the arme, perishing the bone, and cutting
the sinewes close by the arme-pit; the rest not so dangerous.
The master of our shippe had one of his eyes, his
nose, and halfe his face shott away. Master Henry Courton
was slaine. On these two I principally relyed for the
prosecution of our voyage, if God, by sicknesse, or otherwise,
should take me away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spaniards
parley.</div>

<p>The Spaniards with their great ordinance lay continually
playing upon us, and now and then parled and invited us
to surrender ourselves <i>a buena querra</i>.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The captaine of
our shippe, in whose direction and guide, our lives, our
honour, and welfare now remained, seeing many of our
people wounded and slaine, and that few were left to sustaine
and maintaine the fight, or to resist the entry of the
enemy, if he should againe bourd with us, and that our
contraries offered us good pertido,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> came unto me accompanied
with some others, and began to relate the state of
our shippe, and how that many were hurt and slaine, and
scarce any men appeared to traverse the artillery, or to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
oppose themselves for defence, if the enemy should bourd
with us againe; and how that the admirall offered us life
and liberty, and to receive us <i>a buena querra</i>, and to send
us into our owne country. Saying, that if I thought it so
meete, he and the rest were of opinion that we should put
out a flagge of truce, and make some good composition.
The great losse of blood had weakened me much. The
torment of my wounds newly received, made me faint, and
I laboured for life, within short space expecting I should
give up the ghost.</p>

<p>But this parley pearced through my heart, and wounded
my soule; words failed me wherewith to expresse it, and
none can conceive it but he which findeth himselfe in the
like agonie. Yet griefe and rage ministered force, and
caused me to breake forth into this reprehension and execution
following.</p>

<p>“Great is the crosse which Almightie God hath suffered
to come upon me: that assaulted by our professed enemies,
and by them wounded, as you see, in body, lying gasping
for breath, those whom I reputed for my friends to fight
with me; those which I relyed on as my brethren to defend
me in all occasions; those whom I have nourished,
cherished, fostered and loved as my children, to succour
me, helpe me, and to sustaine my reputation in all extremities;
are they who first draw their swords against
me, are they which wound my heart, in giving me up
into mine enemies hands. Whence proceedeth this ingratitude?
whence this faintnesse of heart? whence this
madnesse? Is the cause you fight for unjust? is the
honour and love of your prince and countrey buried in the
dust? your sweete lives, are they become loathsome unto
you? will you exchange your liberty for thraldome? will
you consent to see that which you have sweat for and procured
with so great labour and adventure, at the dispose of
your enemies? can you content your selves to suffer my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
blood spilt before your eyes, and my life bereft me in your
presence, with the blood and lives of your deere brethren
to be unrevenged? Is not an honourable death to be preferred
before a miserable and slavish life? The one sustaining
the honour of our nation, of our predecessors, and
of our societie: the other ignominious to our selves, and
reproachful to our nation. Can you be perswaded that
the enemy will performe his promise with you, that never
leaveth to breake it with others, when he thinketh it advantagious?
And know you not, that with him, all is
convenient that is profitable? Hold they not this for a
maxime: that, <i>nulla fides est servanda cum hereticis</i>? In
which number they accompt us to be. Have you forgotten
their faith violated with my father, in Saint John de Ulua,
the conditions and capitulations being firmed by the vice-roy
and twelve hostages, all principall personages given
for the more securitie of either party to other? Have you
forgotten their promise broken with John Vibao and his
company, in Florida, having conditioned to give them
shipping and victuals, to carry them into their countrey;
immediately after they had delivered their weapons and
armes, had they not their throates cut? Have you forgotten
how they dealt with John Oxnam and his company, in this
sea, yeelded upon composition; and how after a long imprisonment,
and many miseries, being carryed from Panama
to Lyma, and there hanged with all his company, as pyrates,
by the justice?<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> And can you forget how dayly they abuse
our noble natures, which being voyde of malice, measure
all by sinceritie, but to our losse; for that when we come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
to demand performance, they stoppe our mouthes; either
with laying the inquisition upon us, or with delivering us
into the hands of the ordinary justice, or of the kings ministers.
And then urged with their promises, they shrinke up
to the shoulders, and say, that they have now no further
power over us; they sorrow in their hearts to see their
promise is not accomplished: but now they cannot doe us
any good office, but to pray to God for us, and to entreat
the ministers in our behalfe.</p>

<p>“Came we into the South sea to put out flags of truce?
And left we our pleasant England, with all her contentments,
with intention or purpose to avayle our selves of
white ragges, and by banners of peace to deliver ourselves
for slaves into our enemies hands; or to range the world
with the English, to take the law from them, whom by our
swords, prowesse, and valour, we have alwaies heretofore
bin accustomed to purchase honour, riches, and reputation?
If these motives be not sufficient to perswade you,
then I present before your eyes your wives and children,
your parents and friends, your noble and sweete countrey,
your gracious soveraigne; of all which accompt yourselves
for ever deprived, if this proposition should be put in execution.
But for all these, and for the love and respect you
owe me, and for all besides that you esteeme and hold dear
in this world, and for Him that made us and all the world,
banish out of your imagination such vaine and base
thoughts; and according to your woonted resolution, prosecute
the defence of your shippe, your lives, and libertie,
with the lives and libertie of your companions; who by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
their wounds and hurts are disabled and deprived of all
other defence and helpe, save that which lyeth in your discretions
and prowesse. And you, captaine,&mdash;of whom I
made choise amongst many, to be my principall assistant,
and the person to accomplish my dutie if extraordinary
casualtie should disable me to performe and prosecute our
voyage,&mdash;tender your obligation; and now in the occasion
give testimony, and make proofe of your constancie and
valour, according to the opinion and confidence I have ever
held of you.”</p>

<p>Whereunto he made answere: “My good generall, I hope
you have made experience of my resolution, which shall be
ever to put in execution what you shall be pleased to
command me; and my actions shall give testimonie of the
obligation wherein I stand bound unto you. What I have
done, hath not proceeded from faintnesse of heart, nor
from a will to see imaginations put in execution; for besides
the losse of our reputation, liberty, and what good
else we can hope for, I know the Spaniard too too well,
and the manner of his proceedings in discharge of promises:
but only to give satisfaction to the rest of the company,
which importuned me to moove this point, I condiscended
to that which now I am ashamed of, and grieve at, because
I see it disliking to you. And here I vowe to fight it out,
till life or lymmes fayle me. Bee you pleased to recommend
us to Almightie God, and to take comfort in him,
whom I hope will give us victory, and restore you to health
and strength, for all our comforts, and the happy accomplishing
and finishing of our voyage, to his glory.”</p>

<p>I replyed: “This is that which beseemeth you; this sorteth
to the opinion I ever held of you; and this will gaine you,
with God and man, a just reward. And you the rest, my
deere companions and friends, who ever have made a demonstration
of desire to accomplish your duties, remember
that when we first discryed our enemy, you shewed to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
a longing to proove your valours against him: now that
the occasion is offered, lay hold of the fore-locke; for if
once shee turne her backe, make sure accompt never after
to see her face againe: and as true English men, and followers
of the steppes of our forefathers, in vertue and
valour, sell your bloods and lives deerely, that Spaine may
ever record it with sadnesse and griefe. And those which
survive, rejoyce in the purchase of so noble a victory, with
so small meanes against so powerfull an enemy.”</p>

<p>Hereunto they made answere: that as hitherto they had
beene conformable to all the undertakings which I had
commanded or counselled, so they would continue in the
selfe same dutie and obedience to the last breath; vowing
either to remaine conquerours and free-men, or else to sell
their lives at that price which their enemies should not
willingly consent to buy them at. And with this resolution,
both captaine and company tooke their leave of me, every
one particularly, and the greater part with teares and imbracings,
though we were forthwith to depart the world,
and never see one the other againe but in heaven, promising
to cast all forepassed imaginations into oblivion, and never
more to speake of surrendry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They resolve
to fight it
out.</div>

<p>In accomplishment of this promise and determination,
they persevered in sustaining the fight, all this night, with
the day and night following, and the third day after. In
which time the enemy never left us, day nor night, beating
continually upon us with his great and small shott. Saving
that every morning, an hower before the breake of day, he
<span class="sidenote">The enemy
breatheth.</span>
edged a little from us, to breath, and to remedie such defects
as were amisse, as also to consult what they should
doe the day and night following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English
repaire their
defects.</div>

<p>This time of interdiction, we imployed in repayring our
sayles and tacklings, in stopping our leakes, in fishing and
wolling our masts and yards, in mending our pumpes, and
in fitting and providing our selves for the day to come.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Though this was but little space for so many workes, yet
gave it great reliefe and comfort unto us, and made us
better able to endure the defence: for otherwise, our ship
must of force have suncke before our surrendry, having
many shot under water, and our pumpes shot to peeces
every day. In all this space, not any man of either part
tooke rest or sleepe, and little sustenance, besides bread
and wine.</p>

<p>In the second dayes fight, the vice-admirall comming
upon our quarter, William Blanch, one of our masters
mates, with a luckie hand, made a shot unto her with one
of our sterne peeces; it carried away his maine mast close
by the decke: wherewith the admirall beare up to her, to
see what harme shee had received, and to give her such
succour as shee was able to spare; which we seeing, were
in good hope that they would have now left to molest us
any longer, having wherewithall to entertaine themselves
<span class="sidenote">Advantages
omitted.</span>
in redressing their owne harmes. And so we stood away
from them close by as we could; which we should not
have done, but prosecuted the occasion, and brought our
selves close upon her weather gage, and with our great
and small shot hindered them from repairing their harmes:
if we had thus done, they had beene forced to cut all by
the bourd; and it may bee, lying a hull or to le-wards of
us, with a few shot wee might have suncke her. At the
least, it would have declared to our enemies that wee had
them in little estimation, when, able to goe from them, we
would not; and perhaps bin a cause to have made them
to leave us.</p>

<p>But this occasion was let slip, as also that other to fight
with them, sayling quarter winds, or before the winde; for
having stood off to sea a day and a night, we had scope to
fight at our pleasure; and no man, having sea roome, is
bound to fight as his enemie will, with disadvantage, being
able otherwise to deal with equalitie; contrariwise, every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
man ought to seeke the meanes hee can for his defence,
and greatest advantage, to the annoyance of his contrarie.</p>

<p>Now wee might, with our fore saile low set, have borne
upp before the winde, and the enemie of force must have
done the like, if he would fight with us, or keepe us company:
and then should wee have had the advantage of
them. For although their artillery were longer, waightier,
and many more then ours, and in truth did pierce with
greater violence; yet ours being of greater bore, and
<span class="sidenote">The difference
of shot.</span>
carrying a waightier and greater shot, was of more importance
and of better effect for sinking and spoyling: for the
smaller shot passeth through, and maketh but his whole,
and harmeth that which lyeth in his way; but the greater
shaketh and shivereth all it meeteth, and with the splinters,
or that which it encountreth, many times doth more hurt
then with his proper circumference: as is plainely seene
in the battery by land, when the saker, the demy-colverin,
<span class="sidenote">Their effects.</span>
the colverin, and demi-cannon (being peeces that reach
much further point blanke then the cannon), are nothing
of like importance for making the breach, as is the cannon;
for that this shot being ponderous, pierceth with difficultie,
yea worketh better effects, tormenting, shaking, and overthrowing
all; whereas the others, with their violence,
pierce better, and make onely their hole, and so hide themselves
in the wooll or rampire.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>Besides, our ship being yare<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and good of steeridge, no
doubt but we should have played better with our ordinance,
and with more effect then did our enemies; which was a
<span class="sidenote">Errors in
fight,</span>
great errour, being able to fight with lesse disadvantage, and
yet to fight with the most that could be imagined, which
I knew not off, neither was able to direct though I had
knowne it, being in a manner senselesse, what with my
wounds, and what with the agony of the surrendry propounded,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
for that I had seldome knowne it spoken of, but
that it came afterwards to be put in execution.</p>

<p>The generall not being able to succour his vice-admirall,
except he should utterly leave us, gave them order to shift
as well as they could for the present, and to beare with the
next port, and there to repayre their harmes. Himselfe
presently followed the chase, and in short space fetched us
up, and beganne a fresh to batter us with his great and
small shott. The vice-admirall, having saved what they
could, cutt the rest by the bourd, and with fore-sayle and
myson came after us also; and before the setting of the
sunne, were come upon our broad side, wee bearing all
our sayles, and after kept us company, lying upon our
weather quarter, and annoying us what shee could.</p>

<p>Here I hold it necessary, to make mention of two things
which were most prejudiciall unto us, and the principall
causes of our perdition; the errours and faults of late dayes,
<span class="sidenote">learned
from the
Flemings
and Easterlings.</span>
crept in amongst those who follow the sea, and learned
from the Flemings and Easterlings. I wish that by our
misfortunes others would take warning, and procure to
redresse them, as occasions shall be offered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
1. To fight
unarmed.<br />
2. To drinke
to excesse.
</div>

<p>The one, is to fight unarmed, where they may fight
armed. The other is, in comming to fight, to drinke
themselves drunke. Yea, some are so madd, that they
mingle powder with wine, to give it the greater force,
imagining that it giveth spirit, strength, and courage, and
taketh away all feare and doubt. The latter is for the
most part true, but the former is false and beastly, and
altogether against reason. For though the nature of wine,
with moderation, is to comfort and revive the heart, and to
fortifie and strengthen the spirit; yet the immoderate
use thereof worketh quite contrary effects.</p>

<p>In fights, all receipts which add courage and spirit, are
of great regard, to be allowed and used; and so is a draught
of wine, to be given to every man before he come to action,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
but more then enough is pernicious; for exceeding the
same, it offendeth, and enfeebleth the sences, converting the
strength (which should resist the force of the enemy) into
weaknesse: it dulleth and blindeth the understanding, and
consequently depraveth any man of true valour; for that
he is disenabled to judge and apprehend the occasion which
may be offered, to assault and retyre in time convenient;
the raynes of reason being put into the hands of passion
and disorder. For after I was wounded, this <i>nimium</i> bred
great disorder and inconvenience in our shippe; the pott
continually walking, infused desperate and foolish hardinesse
in many, who blinded with the fume of the liquor,
considered not of any danger, but thus and thus would
stand at hazard; some in vaine glory vaunting themselves;
some other rayling upon the Spaniards; another inviting
his companion to come and stand by him, and not to budge
a foote from him; which indiscreetly they put in execution,
and cost the lives of many a good man, slaine by our enemies
muskettiers, who suffered not a man to shew himselfe,
but they presently overthrew him with speed and watchfullnesse.
For prevention of the second errour, although
I had great preparation of armours, as well of proofe, as of
light corseletts, yet not a man would use them; but esteemed
a pott of wine a better defence then an armour of
proofe. Which truely was great madnesse, and a lamentable
fault, worthy to be banished from amongst all reasonable
people, and well to be weighed by all commanders.
<span class="sidenote">The Spaniard
surpasseth
us
in temperance.</span>
For if the Spaniard surpasseth us in any thing, it is in his
temperance and suffering: and where he hath had the
better hand of us, it hath beene, for the most part, through
our own folly; for that we will fight unarmed with him
being armed. And although I have heard many men
maintaine, that in shipping, armour is of little profit: all
men of good understanding will condemne such desperate
ignorance. For besides, that the sleightest armour secureth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
the parts of a mans body, which it covereth, from pike,
sword, and all hand weapons, it likewise giveth boldnesse
and courage: a man armed, giveth a greater and a waightier
blow, then a man unarmed; he standeth faster, and with
greater difficultie is to be overthrowne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The use and
profit of
arming,</div>

<p>And I never read, but that the glistering of the armour
hath beene by authors observed, for that, as I imagine,
his show breedeth terror in his contraries, and despayre to
himselfe if he be unarmed. And therefore in time of
warre, such as devote themselves to follow the profession
of armes, by sea or by land, ought to covet nothing more
then to be well armed; for as much as it is the second
meanes, next Gods protection, for preserving and prolonging
many mens lives.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">exactly observed
by
the Spanish.</div>

<p>Wherein the Spanish nation deserveth commendation
above others; every one, from the highest to the lowest,
putting their greatest care in providing faire and good
armes. He which cannot come to the price of a corslet,
will have a coat of mayle, a jackett, at least a buffe-jerkin,
or a privie coate. And hardly will they be found without
it, albeit they live and serve, for the most part, in extreame
hott countries.</p>

<p>Whereas I have knowne many bred in cold countries,
in a moment complaine of the waight of their armes,
that they smoother them, and then cast them off, chusing
rather to be shott through with a bullet, or lanched through
with a pike, or thrust through with a sword, then to endure
a little travaile and suffering. But let me give these lazie
ones this lesson, that he that will goe a warre-fare, must
resolve himselfe to fight; and he that putteth on this resolution,
must be contented to endure both heate and waight:
first for the safeguard of his life, and next for subduing of
his enemie; both which are hazarded, and put into great
danger, if he fight unarmed with an enemy armed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Armes more
necessary by
sea, then at
land.</div>

<p>Now for mine owne opinion, I am resolved that armour
is more necessary by sea then by land, yea, rather to be
excused on the shore then in the shippe. My reason is,
for that on the shore, the bullet onely hurteth, but in the
shippe I have seene the splinters kill and hurt many at
once, and yet the shott to have passed without touching
any person. As in the galeon in which I came out of the
Indies, in anno 1597, in the rode of Tercera, when the
Queenes Majesties shippes, under the charge of the Earle
of Essex, chased us into the rode, with the splinters of one
shott, were slaine, maymed, and sore hurt, at the least a
dozen persons, the most part whereof had beene excused,
if they had beene armed.</p>

<p>And doubtlesse, if these errours had beene foreseene,
and remedied by us, many of those who were slaine and
hurt, had beene on foote, and we inabled to have sustained
and maintained the fight much better and longer, and
perhaps at last had freed our selves. For if our enemy
had come to bourd with us, our close fights were such, as
we were secure, and they open unto us. And what with our
cubridge heads, one answering the other, our hatches upon
bolts, our brackes in our deckes and gunner roome, it was
impossible to take us as long as any competent number of
men had remained: twentie persons would have sufficed for
defence; and for this, such ships are called impregnable,
and are not to be taken, but by surrender, nor to be overcome
but with bourding or sinking, as in us by experience
was verified. And not in us alone, but in the <i>Revenge</i> of
the Queenes Majestie, which being compassed round about
with all the armado of Spaine, and bourded sundry times
by many at once, is said to have sunke three of the armado
by her side.</p>

<p>And in this conflict, having lost all her mastes, and
being no other then a logge in the sea, could not be taken
with all their force and pollicie, till she surrendred her
selfe by an honourable composition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>By these presidents,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> let governours by sea take speciall
care, above all, to preserve their people, in imitation of the
French; who carrie many souldiers in their shippes of
warre, and secure them in their holdes, till they come to
entring, and to prove their forces by the dint of sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A difference
for commanders.</div>

<p>But here the discreete commaunders are to put difference,
betwixt those which defend, and those which are to
offend, and betwixt those which assault, and those which are
assaulted. For, as I have sayd, no government whatsoever,
better requireth a perfect and experimented commaunder,
then that of the sea. And so no greater errour can be
committed, then to commend such charges to men unexperimented
in this profession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Race-ships
of warre
disliked.</div>

<p>A third and last cause, of the losse of sundry of our men,
most worthy of note for all captaines, owners, and carpenters,
was the race<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> building of our shippe, the onely fault
shee had; and now a-dayes, held for a principall grace in
any shippe: but by the experience which I have had, it
seemeth for sundry reasons verie prejudiciall for shippes of
warre. For in such, those which tackle the sayles, of force
must bee upon the deckes, and are open without shelter
or any defence: yet here it will be objected, that for this
<span class="sidenote">Wast clothes
not so useful</span>
inconvenience, wast clothes are provided, and for want of
them, it is usuall to lace a bonnet, or some such shadow
for the men: worthily may it bee called a shadow, and one
of the most pernitious customes that can be used; for this
shadow, or defence, being but of linnen or wollen cloth,
emboldeneth many, who without it would retire to better
securitie; whereas, now thinking themselves unseene, they
become more bould then otherwise they would, and thereby
shot through when they least thinke of it. Some captaines
observing this errour, have sought to remedie it in some
of his Majesties shippes; not by altering the building, but
<span class="sidenote">as other
devises.</span>
by devising a certaine defence, made of foure or five inch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
planckes, of five foote high, and sixe foote broad, running
upon wheeles, and placed in such partes of the shippe as
are most open. These they name blenders, and made of
elme for the most part; for that it shivers not with a shot,
as oake and other timber will doe, which are now in use
and service: but best it is, when the whole side hath one
blender, and one armour of proofe, for defence of those
which of force must labour and be aloft.</p>

<p>This race building, first came in by overmuch homing<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
in of our shippes; and received for good, under colour of
making our shippes thereby the better sea-shippes, and of
better advantage to hull and trye: but in my judgement,
it breedeth many inconveniences, and is farre from working
the effect they pretend, by disinabling them for bearing
their cage worke correspondent to the proportion and
mould of the shippe, making them tender sided, and unable
to carry sayle in any fresh gaile of winde, and diminishing
the play of their artillery, and the place for accommodating
their people to fight, labor, or rest.</p>

<p>And I am none of those who hold opinion that the over-much
homing in, the more the better, is commodious and
easier for the shippe; and this out of the experience that
I have learned, which with forcible reasons I could prove
to be much rather discomodious and worthy to be reformed.
But withall, I hold it not necessary to discourse here of
that particularitie, but leave the consequence to men of
understanding, and so surcease.</p>

<h3>SECTION LXII.</h3>

<p>All this second day, and the third day and night, our
captaine and company susteined the fight, notwithstanding
the disadvantage where with they fought; the enemie being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
ever to wind-ward, and wee to lee-ward, their shott much
<span class="sidenote">The disadvantage
of ships
to lee-ward.</span>
damnifying us, and ours little annoying them; for whensoever
a man encountreth with his enemie at sea, in
gayning the weather gage, hee is in possibilitie to sinke his
contrary, but his enemie cannot sinke him; and therefore
<span class="sidenote">And the best
remedie.</span>
hee which is forced to fight with this disadvantage, is to
procure by all meanes possible to shoote downe his contraries
masts or yards, and to teare or spoyle his tackling
and sayles; for which purpose, billets of some heavy wood
fitted to the great ordinance, are of great importance. And
so are arrows of fire, to bee shott out of slur-bowes, and
cases of small shott, joyned two and two together, with
peeces of wyer, of five or sixe ynches long, which also shot
out of muskets are of good effect, for tearing the sayles or
cutting the tackling.</p>

<p>Some are of opinion that crosse barres and chaine-shot
are of moment for the spoyling of masts and yards; but
experience dayly teacheth them not to be of great importance,
though neere at hand, I confesse, they worke great
execution; but the round shott is the onely principall
and powerfull meane to breake mast or yard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spaniards
fore-mast
thrice
shot through.</div>

<p>And in this our fight, the admirall of the Spaniards had
his fore-mast shot through with two round shott, some
three yardes beneath the head; had either of them entred
but foure ynches further into the heart of the mast, without
all doubt it had freed us, and perhaps put them into
our hands. The third day, in the after-noone, which was
the 22nd of June 1594, according to our computation,
and which I follow in this my discourse, our sayles being
torne, our mastes all perished, our pumpes rent and shot
to peeces, and our shippe with fourteene shott under
water and seven or eight foote of water in hold; many of
our men being slaine, and the most part of them which
remayned sore hurt, and in a manner altogether fruiteles,
and the enemie offering still to receive us <i>a buena querra</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
and to give us life and libertie, and imbarkation for our
countrey;&mdash;our captaine, and those which remayned of
our company, were all of opinion that our best course was
to surrender our selves before our shippe suncke. And so
by common consent agreed the second time to send a servant
of mine, Thomas Sanders, to signifie unto mee the
estate of our shippe and company: and that it was impossible
by any other way to expect for hope of deliverance,
or life, but by the miraculous hand of God, in using his
Almighty power, or by an honourable surrender: which
in every mans opinion was thought most convenient. So
was I desired by him to give also my consent, that the
captaine might capitulate with the Spanish generall, and
to compound the best partido he could by surrendring our
selves into his hands, upon condition of life and libertie.
This hee declared unto me, being in a manner voyd of
sence, and out of hope to live or recover; which considered,
and the circumstances of his relation, I answered as I
could, that hee might judge of my state, readie every
moment to give up the ghost, and unable to discern in
this cause what was convenient, except I might see the
present state of the shippe. And that the honour or dishonour,
the welfare or misery was for them, which should
be partakers of life. At last, for that I had satisfaction of
his valour and true dealing in all the time hee had served
me, and in correspondence of it, had given him (as was
notorious) charge and credit in many occasions, I bound
him, by the love and regard hee ought me, and by the faith
and duty to Almighty God, to tell me truely if all were as
he had declared. Whereunto hee made answere, that hee
had manifested unto mee the plaine and naked truth, and
that hee tooke God to witnesse of the same truth; with
which receiving satisfaction, I forced my selfe what I
could to perswade him to annimate his companions, and in
my name to intreate the captaine and the rest to persevere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
in defence of their libertie, lives, and reputation, remitting
all to his discretion: not doubting but he would be tender
of his dutie, and zealous of my reputation, in preferring
his liberty, and the liberty of the company, above all respects
whatsoever. As for the welfare hoped by a surrender,
I was altogether unlikely to be partaker thereof,
death threatning to deprive me of the benefit which the
enemie offered; but if God would bee pleased to free us,
the joy and comfort I should receive, might perhaps give
me force and strength to recover health.</p>

<p>Which answere being delivered to the captaine, hee
presently caused a flagge of truce to be put in place of our
ensigne, and began to parley of our surrendry, with a
Spaniard, which Don Beltran appointed for that purpose,
from the poope of the admirall, to offer in his name, the
conditions before specified; with his faithful promise and
oath, as the king generall, to take us <i>a buena querra</i>, and
to send us all into our owne countrey. The promise hee
accepted, and sayd that under the same hee yeelded, and
surrendred himselfe, shippe, and company. Immediately
there came unto me another servant of mine, and told me
that our captaine had surrendred himselfe, and our shippe;
which understood, I called unto one Juan Gomes de Pineda,
a Spanish pilote, which was our prisoner, and in all the fight
we had kept close in hold, and willed him to goe to the
generall Don Beltran de Castro from mee, to tell him that
if he would give us his word and oath, as the generall of
the king, and some pledge for confirmation, to receive us
<i>a buena querra</i>, and to give us our lives and libertie, and
present passage into our owne countrey, that we would
surrender ourselves and shippe into his hands; otherwise,
that he should never enjoy of us nor ours, any thing but a
resolution every man to dye fighting.</p>

<p>With this message I dispatched him, and called unto me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
all my company, and encouraged them to sacrifice their
lives fighting and killing the enemie, if he gave but a fillip
to any of our companions. The Spaniards willed us to
hoise out our boate, which was shott all to peeces, and so
was theirs. Seeing that he called to us to amaine our
sayles, which we could not well doe, for that they were
slung, and wee had not men inough to hand them. In
this parley, the vice-admirall comming upon our quarter,
and not knowing of what had past, discharged her two
chase peeces at us, and hurt our captaine very sore in the
thigh, and maimed one of our masters mates, called Hugh
Maires, in one of his armes; but after knowing us to be
<span class="sidenote">The English
surrender.</span>
rendred, hee secured us: and we satisfying them that wee
could not hoise out our boate, nor strike our sayles, the
admirall layd us abourd; but before any man entred, John
Gomes went unto the generall, who received him with
great curtesie, and asked him what we required; whereunto
he made answere that my demand was, that in the
Kings name, he should give us his faith and promise to
give us our lives, to keepe the lawes of fayre warres and
quarter, and to send us presently into our countrey; and
in confirmation hereof, that I required some pledge:
whereunto the generall made answere: that in the Kings
Majesties name, his master, hee received us <i>a buena querra</i>,
and swore by God Almightie, and by the habit of Alcantara
(whereof he had received knighthood, and in token
whereof hee wore in his breast a greene crosse, which is
the ensigne of that order), that he would give us our lives
with good entreatie, and send us as speedily as he could
into our owne countrey. In confirmation whereof, he took
of his glove, and sent it to mee as a pledge.</p>

<p>With this message John Gomes returned, and the
Spaniards entred and tooke possession of our shippe, every
one crying, <i>Buena querra, buena querra! oy por mi, maniana</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
<i>por ti</i>:<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> with which our company began to secure themselves.</p>

<p>The generall was a principall gentleman of the ancient
nobilitie of Spaine, and brother to the Conde de Lemos,
whose intention no doubt was according to his promise;
and therefore considering that some bad intreaty, and insolency,
might be offered unto me in my shippe, by the
common souldiers, who seldome have respect to any person
in such occasions, especially in the case I was, whereof hee
had enformed himselfe: for prevention, hee sent a principall
captaine, brought up long time in Flaunders, called
Pedro Alveres de Pulgar, to take care of me, and whilest
the shippes were one abourd the other, to bring me into
his ship; which he accomplished with great humanitie and
courtesie; despising the barres of gold which were shared
before his face, which hee might alone have enjoyed if he
would. And truely hee was, as after I found by tryall, a
true captaine, a man worthy of any charge, and of the
noblest condition that I have knowne any Spaniard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mildnes
of a generall
after victorie.</div>

<p>The generall received me with great courtesie and compassion,
even with teares in his eyes, and words of great
consolation, and commaunded mee to bee accommodated
in his owne cabbine, where hee sought to cure and comfort
mee the best he could: the like hee used with all our hurt
men, six and thirtie at least. And doubtlesse, as true
courage, valour, and resolution, is requisit in a generall in
the time of battle, so humanitie, mildnes, and courtesie,
after victorie.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXIII.</h3>

<p>Whilst the shippes were together, the maine-mast of the
<i>Daintie</i> fell by the bourd, and the people being occupied in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
ransacking and seeking for spoile and pillage, neglected
the principall; whereof ensued, that within a short space
the <i>Daintie</i> grew so deepe with water, which increased for
want of prevention, that all who were in her desired to forsake
her, and weaved and cryed for succour to bee saved,
being out of hope of her recoverie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Daintie</i>
in danger of
perishing.</div>

<p>Whereupon, the generall calling together the best experimented
men hee had, and consulted with them what
was best to bee done; it was resolved that generall Michaell
Angell should goe abourd the <i>Daintie</i>, and with him threescore
marriners, as many souldiers, and with them the
English men who were able to labour, to free her from
water, and to put her in order if it were possible; and then
to recover Perico the port of Panama; for that, of those to
wind-wards, it was impossible to turne up to any of them,
and neerer then to le-ward was not any that could supply
our necessities and wants; which lay from us east north-east,
above two hundreth leagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Michaell
Arckangell
recovereth
the ship.</div>

<p>Michaell Angell being a man of experience and care,
accomplished that he tooke in hand; although in clearing
and bayling the water, in placing a pumpe, and in fitting
and mending her fore-saile, he spent above six and thirtie
howers.</p>

<p>During which time the shippes lay all a hull; but this
worke ended, they set sayle, and directed their course for
the iles of Pearles. And for that the <i>Daintie</i> sayled badly,
what for want of her maine-sayle, and with the advantage
which all the South-sea shippes have of all those built in
our North-sea, the admirall gave her a tawe;<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> which notwithstanding,
the wind calming with us as we approached
neerer to the land, twelve dayes were spent before we could
fetch sight of the ilands; which lye alongst the coast, beginning
some eight leagues, west south-west from Panama,
and run to the south-wards neere thirtie leagues. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
are many, and the most unhabited; and those which have
people, have some negroes, slaves unto the Spaniards, which
occupie themselves in labour of the land, or in fishing for
pearles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fishing for
pearles.</div>

<p>In times past, many inriched themselves with that trade,
but now it is growne to decay. The manner of fishing for
pearles is, with certaine long pinaces or small barkes, in
which there goe foure, five, sixe, or eight negroes, expert
swimmers, and great deevers,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> whom the Spaniards call
<i>busos</i>; with tract of time, use, and continuall practise,
having learned to hold their breath long under water, for
the better atchieving their worke. These throwing themselves
into the sea, with certaine instruments of their art,
goe to the bottome, and seeke the bankes of the oysters in
which the pearles are ingendred, and with their force and
art remouve them from their foundation; in which they
spend more or lesse time, according to the resistance the
firmnes of the ground affordeth. Once loosed, they put
them into a bagge under their armes, and after bring them
up into their boates. Having loaden it, they goe to the
shoare; there they open them and take out the pearles:
they lie under the uttermost part of the circuite of the
oyster, in rankes and proportions, under a certaine part,
which is of many pleights and folds, called the ruffe, for
the similitude it hath unto a ruffe.</p>

<p>The pearles increase in bignes, as they be neerer the end
or joynt of the oyster. The meate of those which have these
pearles is milkie, and not very wholesome to be eaten.</p>

<p>In anno 1583, in the iland of Margarita,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> I was at the
dregging of pearle oysters, after the manner we dregge
oysters in England; and with mine owne hands I opened
many, and tooke out the pearles of them, some greater,
some lesse, and in good quantitie.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>How the pearle is ingendred in the oyster, or mussell,
for they are found in both, divers and sundry are the
opinions, but some ridiculous: whereof, because many
famous and learned men have written largely, I will speake
no more then hath beene formerly spoken, but referre their
curious desires to Pliny, with other ancient and moderne
authors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The places
where pearle
are found.</div>

<p>They are found in divers parts of the world, as in the
West Indies, in the South sea, in the East Indian sea, in
the Straites of Magellane, and in the Scottish sea.</p>

<p>Those found neere the pooles<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> are not perfect, but are of
a thick colour; whereas such as are found neere the line,
are most orient and transparent: the curious call it their
water: and the best is a cleare white shining, with fierie
flames. And those of the East India have the best reputation,
though as good are found in the West India; the
choice ones are of great valew and estimation; but the
greatest that I have read or heard of, was found in these
ilands of Pearles; the which king Phillip the Second of
Spaine gave to his daughter Elizabeth, wife to Albertus,
arch-duke of Austria, and governour of the states of Flaunders;
in whose possession it remaineth, and is called <i>la
peregrina</i>,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> for the rarenes of it; being as bigge as the

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXIV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The generall
continueth
his honourable
usage
towards the
sicke and
wounded.</div>

<p>In this navigation, after our surrender, the generall tooke
especial care for the good intreaty of us, and especially of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
those who were hurt. And God so blessed the hands of our
surgians (besides that they were expert in their art), that
of all our wounded men not one died that was alive the day
after our surrendry: the number whereof was neere fortie;
and many of them with eight, ten, or twelve wounds, and
some with more. The thing that ought to move us to give
God Almighty especiall thankes and prayses, was, that they
were cured in a manner without instruments or salves.
For the chests were all broken to peeces, and many of their
simples and compounds throwne into the sea; those which
remained, were such as were throwne about the shippe in
broken pots and baggs; and such as by the Divine Providence
were reserved, at the end of three dayes, by order
from the generall, were commaunded to be sought and
gathered together. These with some instruments of small
moment, bought and procured from those who had reserved
them to a different end, did not onely serve for our cures,
but also for the curing of the Spaniards, being many more
then those of our company.</p>

<p>For the Spanish surgians were altogether ignorant in
their profession, and had little or nothing wherewith to
cure. And I have noted, that the Spaniards, in generall,
are nothing so curious in accommodating themselves with
good and carefull surgeans, nor to fit them with that which
belongeth to their profession, as other nations are, though
they have greater neede then any that I do know.</p>

<p>At the time of our surrender, I had not the Spanish
tongue, and so was forced to use an interpreter, or the
Latine, or French, which holpe me much for the understanding
of those which spake to me in Spanish, together
with a little smattering I had of the Portugall.</p>

<p>Through the noble proceeding of Don Beltran with us,
and his particular care towards me, in curing and comforting
me, I began to gather heart, and hope of life, and
health; my servants, which were on foote, advised me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
ordinarily of that which past. But some of our enemies,
badly inclined, repined at the proceedings of the generall,
and sayd he did ill to use us so well; that we were Lutherans;
and for that cause, the faith which was given us,
was not to be kept nor performed. Others, that wee had
fought as good souldiers, and therefore deserved good
quarter: others nicknamed us with the name of <i>corsarios</i>,
or pirats; not discerning thereby that they included themselves
within the same imputation. Some were of opinion,
that from Panama, the generall would send us into Spaine:
others sayd that he durst not dispose of us but by order
from the vice-roy of Peru, who had given him his authority.
This hit the nayle on the head.</p>

<p>To all I gave the hearing, and laid up in the store-house
of my memory that which I thought to be of substance;
and in the store-house of my consideration, endevoured to
frame a proportionable resolution to all occurants, conformable
to Gods most holy will. Withall I profitted my
selfe of the meanes which should be offered, and beare
greatest probabilitie to worke our comfort, helpe, and remedie.
And so as time ministered opportunitie, I began,
and endevoured to satisfie the generall and the better sort
in the points I durst intermeddle. And especially to perswade,
by the best reasons I could, that wee might be
sent presently from Panama; alleaging the promise given
us, the cost and charges ensuing, which doubtles would be
such as deserved consideration and excuse: besides, that
now whilest he was in place, and power and authority in
his hands, to performe with us, that hee would looke into
his honour, and profit himselfe of the occasion, and not put
us into the hands of a third person; who perhaps being
more powerfull then himselfe, he might be forced to pray
and intreate the performance of his promise: whereunto
hee gave us the hearing, and bare us in hand that hee
would doe what hee could.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>The generall, and all in generall, not onely in the Peru,
but in all Spaine, and the kingdomes thereof, before our
surrendry, held all English men of warre to be corsarios,
or pirats; which I laboured to reforme, both in the Peru,
and also in the counsels of Spaine, and amongst the chieftaines,
souldiers, and better sort, with whom I came to
have conversation: alleadging that a pirate or corsario, is
<span class="sidenote">What a
pirate is.</span>
hee, which in time of peace or truce, spoyleth or robbeth
those which have peace or truce with them: but the
English have neyther peace nor truce with Spaine, but
warre; and therefore not to be accounted pirats. Besides,
Spaine broke the peace with England, and not England
with Spaine; and that by ymbargo,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> which of all kindes of
<span class="sidenote">Three sorts
of defiances.</span>
defiances is most reproved, and of least reputation; the
ransoming of prysoners, and that by the cannon being
more honorable; but above all, the most honorable is with
trumpet and herald to proclaime and denounce the warre
by publicke defiance. And so if they should condemne
the English for pirats, of force they must first condemne
themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, pirats are those who range the seas without
licence from their prince; who when they are met with,
are punished more severely by their owne lords, then when
they fall into the hands of strangers: which is notorious
to be more severely prosecuted in England, in time of
peace, then in any of the kingdomes of Christendome.</p>

<p>But the English have all licence, either immediately
from their prince, or from others thereunto authorized, and
so cannot in any sence be comprehended under the name
of pirats, for any hostility undertaken against Spaine or
the dependancies thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The custom
of Spaine for
of warre.</div>

<p>And so the state standing as now it doth; if in Spaine a
particular man should arm a shippe, and goe in warre-fare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
with it against the English, and happened to be taken by
them; I make no question, but the company should bee
intreated according to that manner, which they have ever
used since the beginning of the warre, without making
further inquisition.</p>

<p>Then if hee were rich or poore, to see if hee were able
to give a ransome, in this also they are not very curious.
But if this Spanish shippe should fall athwart his King’s
armado or gallies, I make no doubt but they would hang
the captaine and his companie for pirates. My reason is,
for that by a speciall law, it is enacted, that no man in the
kingdomes of Spaine, may arme any shippe, and goe in
warre-fare, without the King’s speciall licence and commission,
upon paine to be reputed a pirate, and to bee chastised
<span class="sidenote">The custome
of England.</span>
with the punishment due to <i>corsarios</i>. In England
the case is different: for the warre once proclaimed, every
man may arme that will, and hath wherewith; which
maketh for our greater exemption from being comprehended
within the number of pirates.</p>

<p>With these, and other like arguments to this purpose,
(to avoid tediousnes, I omitt): I convinced all those whom
I heard to harpe upon this string: which was of no small
importance for our good entreatie, and motives for many,
to further and favour the accomplishment of the promise
lately made unto us.</p>

<h3>SECTION LXV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">A disputation
concerning
<i>buena
querra</i>.</div>

<p>One day after dinner, as was the ordinary custome, the
generall, his captaines, and the better sort of his followers,
being assembled in the cabbin of the poope in conference,
an eager contention arose amongst them, touching the
capitulation of <i>buena querra</i>, and the purport thereof. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
sayd that onely life and good entreatie of the prisoners was
to be comprehended therein: others enlarged, and restrained
it, according to their humors and experience. In fine, my
opinion was required, and what I had seene and knowne
touching that point: wherein I pawsed a little, and suspecting
the worst, feared that it might be a baite layd to
catch me withall, and so excused my selfe, saying: that
where so many experimented souldiers were joyned together,
my young judgement was little to be respected: whereunto
the generall replied, that knowledge was not alwayes
incident to yeares, though reason requireth that the aged
should be the wisest, but an art acquired by action and
management of affaires; and therefore they would be but
certified what I had seene, and what my judgement was in
this point. Unto which, seeing I could not well excuse
myselfe, I condiscended; and calling my wits together,
holding it better to shoote out my boult by yeelding unto
reason, although I might erre, then to stand obstinate, my
will being at warre with my consent, and fearing my deniall
might be taken for discourtesie, which peradventure might
also purchase me mislike with those who seemed to wish
<span class="sidenote">The resolution,
etc.</span>
me comfort and restitution; I submitted to better judgement,
the reformation of the present assembly, saying:
“Syr, under the capitulation of <i>buena querra</i>, or fayre
warres, I have ever understood, and so it hath beene observed
in these, as also in former times, that preservation
of life and good entreatie of the prisoner have beene comprehended;
and further, by no meanes to be urged to any
thing contrary to his conscience, as touching his religion;
nor to be seduced or menaced from the allegeance due to
his prince and country; but rather to ransome him for his
moneths pay. And this is that which I have knowne practised
in our times, in generall, amongst all civill and noble
<span class="sidenote">The noble
usage of the
English,</span>
nations. But the English have enlarged it one point more
towards the Spaniards rendred <i>a buena querra</i> in these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
warres; have ever delivered them which have beene taken
upon such compositions, without ransome: but the covetousnes
<span class="sidenote">but abused
in these
dayes.</span>
of our age hath brought in many abuses, and excluded
the principall officers from partaking of the benefit
of this privilege, in leaving them to the discretion of the
victor, being, many times, poorer then the common souldiers,
their qualities considered; whereby they are commonly
put to more then the ordinary ransome; and not being able
of themselves to accomplish it, are forgotten of their princes
and sometimes suffer long imprisonment, which they
should not.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Don Beltran
satisfied,
and
answereth.</div>

<p>With this, Don Beltran sayd: “This ambiguitie you
have well resolved;” and, like a worthie gentleman, with
great courtesie and liberalitie, added: “let not the last
point trouble you, but bee of good comfort; for I here give
you my word anew, that your ransome, if any shall be
thought due, shall be but a cople of grey-hounds for mee,
and other two for my brother, the Conde de Lemos: and
this I sweare to you by the habit of Alcantera. Provided
alwayes, that the King, my master, leave you to my dispose,
as of right you belong unto me.”</p>

<p>For amongst the Spaniards in their armadoes, if there
bee an absolute generall, the tenth of all is due to him,
and he is to take choise of the best: where in other countries,
it is by lot that the generalls tenth is given. And
if they be but two shippes, he doth the like; and being but
one, shee is of right the generalls. This I hardly believed,
until I saw a letter, in which the King willed his vice-roy
to give Don Beltran thankes for our shippe and artillerie,
which he had given to his Majestie.</p>

<p>I yeelded to the generall most heartie thankes for his
great favour, wherewith hee bound mee ever to seeke
how to serve him, and deserve it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXVI.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Short arrowes
for
muskets.</div>

<p>In this discourse, generall Michael Angell demanded for
what purpose served the little short arrowes which we had
in our shippe, and those in so great quantitie. I satisfied
them that they were for our muskets. They are not as yet
in use amongst the Spaniards, yet of singular effect and execution,
as our enemies confessed: for the upper worke of
their shippes being musket proofe, in all places they passed
through both sides with facilitie, and wrought extraordinary
disasters; which caused admiration, to see themselves
wounded with small shott, where they thought themselves
secure; and by no meanes could find where they entred,
nor come to the sight of any of the shott.</p>

<p>Hereof they proved to profit themselves after, but for
that they wanted the tampkins, which are first to be driven
home before the arrow be put in; and as they understood
not the secret, they rejected them as uncertaine, and therefore
not to be used: but of all the shot used now a-dayes,
for the annoying of an enemie in fight by sea, few are of
greater moment for many respects, which I hold not convenient
to treat of in publique.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXVII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">John Oxman’s
voyage
to the
South sea.</div>

<p>A little to the south-wards of the iland of Pearle, betwixt
seven and eight degrees, is the great river of Saint
Buena Ventura. It falleth into the South sea with three
mouthes, the head of which is but a little distant from the
North sea. In anno 1575, or 1576, one John Oxman,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Plymouth, going into the West Indies, joyned with the
Symarons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the
Symarons
are.</div>

<p>These are fugitive negroes, and for the bad intreatie
which their masters had given them, were then retyred into
the mountaines, and lived upon the spoyle of such Spaniards
as they could master, and could never he brought into
obedience, till by composition they had a place limmitted
them for their freedome, where they should live quietly by
<span class="sidenote">Their
habitation.</span>
themselves. At this day they have a great habitation neere
Panama, called Saint Iago de Los Negros, well peopled,
with all their officers and commaunders of their owne, save
onely a Spanish governour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
assistance.</div>

<p>By the assistance of these Symarons, hee brought to the
head of this river, by peecemeale, and in many journeys, a
small pinnace; hee fitted it by time in a warlike manner,
and with the choice of his company, put himselfe into the
South sea, where his good hap was to meete with a cople
of shippes of trade, and in the one of them a great quantitie
of gold. And amongst other things, two peeces of speciall
estimation: the one a table of massie gold, with emralds,
sent for a present to the King; the other a lady of
singular beautie, married, and a mother of children. The
<span class="sidenote">John Oxman
capitulateth
with them.</span>
latter grewe to bee his perdition: for hee had capitulated
with these Symarons, that their part of the bootie should
be onely the prisoners, to the ende to execute their malice
upon them (such was the rancor they had conceived against
them, for that they had beene the tyrants of their libertie).
But the Spaniards not contented to have them their slaves,
who lately had beene their lords, added to their servitude,
cruell entreaties. And they againe, to feede their insatiable
revenges, accustomed to rost and eate the hearts of all those
Spaniards, whom at any time they could lay hand upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His folly
and breach
of promise.</div>

<p>John Oxman, I say, was taken with the love of this lady,
and to winne her good will, what through her teares and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
perswasions, and what through feare and detestation of their
barbarous inclinations, breaking promise with the Symarons,
yeelded to her request; which was, to give the prisoners
liberty with their shippes, for that they were not usefull for
him: notwithstanding, Oxman kept the lady, who had in
one of the restored shippes eyther a sonne or a nephew.
<span class="sidenote">His pursuit.</span>
This nephew, with the rest of the Spaniards, made all the
hast they could to Panama, and they used such diligence,
as within fewe howers some were dispatched to seek those
who little thought so quickly too bee overtaken. The pursuers
approaching the river, were doubtfull by which of the
afore-remembred three mouthes they should take their way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And evill
fortune.</div>

<p>In this wavering, one of the souldiers espied certaine
feathers of hennes, and some boughes of trees, which they
had cut off to make their way, swimming down one of the
outlets. This was light sufficient to guide them in their
course; they entred the river, and followed the tracke as
farre as their frigats had water sufficient; and then with
part of their souldiers in their boates, and the rest on the
bankes on eyther side, they marched day and night in pursuite
of their enemies; and in fine came uppon them unexpected,
at the head of the river, making good cheare in
their tents, and devided in two partialities about the partition,
and sharing of their gold. Thus were they surprised,
and not one escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He flyeth
to the
Symarons.</div>

<p>Some say that John Oxman fled to the Symarons, but
they utterly denyed to receive or succour him, for that he
had broken his promise; the onely objection they cast in
his teeth was, that if he had held his word with them, hee
had never fallen into this extremitie.</p>

<p>In fine, hee was taken, and after, his shippe also was
possessed by the Spaniards, which he had hid in a certaine
cove, and covered with boughes of trees, in the guard and
custodie of some foure or five of his followers. All his
company were conveyed to Panama, and there were ymbarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
for Lyma; where a processe was made against them
by the justice, and all condemned and hanged as pirates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Breach of
faith never
unpunished.</div>

<p>This may he a good example to others in like occasions:
first to shunne such notorious sinnes, which cannot escape
punishment in this life, nor in the life to come: for the
breach of faith is reputed amongst the greatest faults which
a man can committ. Secondly, not to abuse another mans
wife, much lesse to force her; both being odious to God
and man. Thirdly, to beware of mutenies, which seldome
or never are seene to come to better ends; for where such
trees flourish, the fruite, of force, must eyther bee bitter,
sweete, or very sower. And therefore, seeing wee vaunt
ourselves to bee Christians, and make profession of His
law who forbiddeth all such vanities; let us faithfully
shunne them, that wee may partake the end of that hope
which our profession teacheth and promiseth.</p>

<hr class="sect" />
<h3>SECTION LXVIII.</h3>

<p>Comming in sight of the ilands of Pearles, the wind began
to fresh in with us, and wee profited our selves of it: but
<span class="sidenote">La Pacheta.</span>
comming thwart of a small iland, which they call la Pacheta,
that lyeth within the Pearle ilands, close abourd the mayne,
and some eight or ten leagues south and by west from
Panama, the wind calmed againe.</p>

<p>This iland belongeth to a private man; it is a round
humock,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> conteyning not a league of ground, but most fertile.
Insomuch, that by the owners industrie, and the
labour of some few slaves, who occupie themselves in manuring
it; and two barkes, which he imployeth in bringing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the fruit it giveth to Panama, it is sayd to bee worth him
every weeke, one with another, a barre of silver, valued
betwixt two hundreth and fiftie or three hundreth pezos;
which in English money, may amount to fiftie or threescore
pounds: and for that which I saw at my being in
Panama, touching this, I hold to be true.</p>

<p>In our course to fetch the port of Panama, wee put our
selves betwixt the iland and the maine: which is a goodly
channell, of three, foure, and five leagues broad, and without
danger, except a man come too neare the shoare on any
side; and that is thought the better course, then to goe a
sea-boord of the ilands, because of the swift running of the
tydes, and the advantage to stop the ebbe: as also for succour,
if a man should happen to bee becalmed at any time
beyond expectation, which happeneth sometimes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The generall
certefieth the
<i>Audiencia</i> of
his successe.</div>

<p>The seventh of July wee had sight of Perico: they are
two little ilands which cause the port of Panama, where all
the shippes used to ride. It is some two leagues west north-west
of the cittie, which hath also a pere<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> in itselfe for small
barkes; at full sea it may have some sixe or seaven foote
water, but at low water it is drie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great
joy of the
Spaniards.</div>

<p>The ninth of July wee anchored under Perico, and the
generall presently advised the <i>Audiencia</i> of that which had
succeeded in his journey: which, understood by them,
caused bonfires to be made, and every man to put luminaries
in their houses. The fashion is much used amongst the
Spaniards in their feasts of joy, or for glad tidings; placing
many lights in their churches, in their windowes, and
galleries, and corners of their houses; which being in the
beginning of the night, and the cittie close by the sea-shore,
showed to us, being farre of, as though the cittie had been
on a light fire.</p>

<p>About eight of the clocke, all the artillery of the citty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
was shott off, which wee might discerne by the flashes of
fire, but could not heare the report; yet the armado being
advised thereof, and in a readinesse, answered them likewise
with all their artillery; which taking ende, as all the
vanities of this earth doe, the generall settled himselfe to
dispatch advise for the King, for the vice-roy of Peru, and
for the vice-roy of the Nova Spana, for hee also had beene
certified of our being in that sea, and had fitted an armado
to seeke us, and to guard his coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note.</div>

<p>But now for a farewell (and note it), let me relate unto
you this secret, how Don Beltran shewed mee a letter from
the King, his master, directed to the vice-roy, wherein he
gave him particular relation of my pretended voyage; of
the ships, their burden, their munition, their number of
men, which I had in them, as perfectly as if he had seene
all with his own eyes: saying unto me, “Heereby may you
discerne whether the King, my master, have friends in
England, and good and speedie advice of all that passeth.”</p>

<p>Whereunto I replyed: “It was no wonder, for that hee
had plentie of gold and silver, which worketh this and more
strange effects: for my journey was publique and notorious
to all the kingdome.” Whereunto hee replyed, that if
I thought is so convenient, leave should be given mee to
write into England to the Queens Majestie, my mistresse,
to my father, and to other personages, as I thought good;
and leaving the letters open, that he would send some of
them in the King’s packet, others to his uncle Don Rodrigo
de Castro, cardinall and archbishoppe of Sevill, and to other
friends of his; not making any doubt but that they would
be speedily in England. For which I thanked him, and
accepted his courtesie; and although I was my selfe unable
to write, yet by the hands of a servant of mine, I wrote
three or foure coppies of one letter to my father, Sir John
Hawkins; in which I briefly made relation of all that had
succeeded in our voyage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>The dispatches of Spaine and New Spaine, went by ordinary
course in ships of advise; but that for the Peru, was
sent by a kinseman of the generalls, called Don Francisco
de la Cuena.</p>

<p>Which being dispatched, Don Beltran hasted all that
ever hee could to put his shippes in order, to returne to
Lyma. Hee caused the <i>Daintie</i> to be grounded and trimmed;
for in those ilands it higheth and falleth some fifteen
or sixteen foote water.</p>

<p>And the generall with his captaines, and some religious
men being aboord her, and new naming her, named her the
<i>Visitation</i>, for that shee was rendred on the day on which
they celebrate the visitation of the blessed Virgin Mary.
In that place, the ground being plaine and without vantage,
whereby to helpe the tender sided and sharpe ships, they are
forced to shore them on either side. In the midest of their
solemnity, her props and shores of one side fayled, and so
shee fell over upon that side suddenly, intreating many of
them which were in her, very badly; and doubtlesse, had
shee bin like the shippes of the South sea, shee had
broken out her bulge: but being without mastes and
empty (for in the South sea, when they bring a-ground
a shippe, they leave neither mast, balast, nor any other
thing abourd, besides the bare hull), her strength was such
as it made no great show to have received any damage;
but the feare shee put them all into was not little, and
caused them to runne out of her faster then a good pace.</p>

<p>In these ilands is no succour nor refreshing; onely in
the one of them is one house of strawe, and a little spring
of small moment. For the water, which the shippes use
for their provision, they fetch from another iland, two
leagues west north-west of these, which they call Tabaga,
having in it some fruite and refreshing, and some fewe
Indians to inhabite it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>What succeeded to mee, and to the rest during our imprisonment,
with the rarities and particularities of the Peru
and Terra Firme, my voyage to Spaine, and the successe,
with the time I spent in prison in the Peru, in the Tercera,
in Sevill, and in Madrid, with the accidents which befell me
in them, I leave for a second part of this discourse, if God
give life and convenient place and rest, necessary for so
tedious and troublesome a worke: desiring God, that is
Almightie, to give his blessing to this and the rest of my
intentions, that it and they may bee fruitefull to His
glory, and the good of all: then shall my desires
be accomplished, and I account myselfe
most happie. To whom be all
glory, and thankes from
all eternitie.</p>

Sir John Hawkins was one of the most distinguished men of
his period. He was a noted commander at sea forty-eight years,
and treasurer of the navy for twenty-two years; and it was generally
owned that he was the author of more useful inventions, and introduced
into the navy better regulations, than any officer before his
time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
Possibly her ladyship’s thoughts may be explained by the consideration
that she compared the objects of the proposed voyage with
those followed out by her husband. He was the first Englishman
who engaged in the inhuman traffic of slaves, and was granted the
unenviable addition to his arms: “a demi moor proper; bound.”</p></div>

The brave defence of Sir Richard Greenfeild, or Greenville, against
nearly the whole Spanish fleet, merits being here recorded: himself
severely wounded and his ship a complete wreck, he ordered her to
be sunk, but to this his officers would not consent, so she surrendered
on terms. Out of one hundred men fit to bear arms, near sixty
survived this glorious action; but hardly a man but carried off some
wounds as memorials of their courage.</p></div>

Probably an abbreviation or misprint for Biscayan. Lediard relates,
that in 1592, an expedition, fitted out against the Spaniards, took a
great Biscayan shipp of six hundred tunnes, laden with all sorts of
small iron-work.</p></div>

This great caracke was taken, after a sharp engagement, by six
ships, part of the expedition alluded to in note 1; which was dispatched
expressly to the Azores, to lie in wait for the East India
carackes. This expedition left under the command of Sir Walter
Raleigh and Sir John Borrough. Sir Walter was, however, superseded
by Sir Martin Forbisher. She was called the “<i>Madre de Dios</i>,” a seven-decked
ship of one hundred and sixty-five feet from stem to stern,
manned with six hundred men. The burthen of this caracke was sixteen
hundred tons, and she carried thirty-two brass guns. Her cargo,
besides jewels, <i>which never came to light</i>, was as follows: spices, drugs,
silks, and calicoes, besides other wares, many in number, but less in
value, as elephant’s teeth, china, cocoa-nuts, hides, ebony, and cloth
made from rinds of trees. All which being appraised, was reckoned to
amount to at least one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. The carracke,
or Carraca, was a large vessel of two masts, used in the India
and Brazilian trade.</p></div>

We ought to profit by the experience of those who precede us.
Had this “gentle warning” been attended to, probably the loss of the
<i>Royal George</i> might have been prevented. She went down at her
anchors while lying at Spithead, the 29th of August, 1782, having
been struck by a squall, while her lower ports were open.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">15</a>
The term admirall, appears formerly to have been applied as well
to the principal ship in a fleet, as to the superior officer. To cite one
among many instances, in an expedition under the Earl of Cumberland,
in 1594, we find the <i>Royal Exchange</i>, Admiral, two hundred and
fifty tons, commanded by Captain George Cave. The <i>May-flower</i>,
two hundred and fifty tons, Vice-Admiral, commanded by Captain W.
Anthony. The <i>Samson</i> Rear-Admiral, by Captain Nicholas Downton,
together with a caravel and pinnace.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">16</a>
A remarkable instance of carelessness occurred in 1801. The
Dutch Frigate <i>Ambuscade</i>, went down by the head half an hour after
leaving her moorings in Sheerness harbour. This arose from the hawse
holes being unusually large, and the plugs not in.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a>
This is sound advice and good seamanship. In turning to wind-ward,
it is wise to keep in the fair way, so that in case of missing stays,
you have not a danger under your lee.</p></div>

In the list of seven ships composing Lord Thomas Howard’s fleet,
we find the <i>Foresight</i>, Captain Vavisour. He deserves great credit for
attempting to yield what succour he was able to the gallant Sir R.
Greenville, whose brave defence has been already alluded to in <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>.
One other vessel followed, or perhaps set, the example: the <i>George
Noble</i>, of London, falling under the lee of the <i>Revenge</i>, asked Sir
Richard if he had anything to command him; but as he was one of the
victuallers and but of small force, Sir Richard bid him shift for himself,
and leave him to his fortune. Lediard adds in a note, that it is
more than probable had all the other vessels behaved with the same
vigour and resolution as Sir Richard and his company, they might
have given a good account of the Spanish fleet. It is to be regretted
the name of the commander of the <i>George Noble</i> is not recorded. We
know not which to admire most, his bravery in fully acting up to the
principle of “succouring a known friend in view,” or the magnanimity
of Sir Richard in dismissing him from an unequal contest.</p></div>

From the account in Lediard, it appears that Sir A. Shyrley failed
in his object; but he deserves credit for effecting a safe retreat to his
ships in the face of a superior force. The expedition under Sir F.
Drake was successful. It is curious to notice how the titles of
military rank have changed since those days. The troops were commanded
by Christopher Carlisle, an experienced officer; under him
Captain A. Powel, <i>Sergeant Major</i>; Captain M. Morgan, and Captain
J. Sampson, <i>Corporals of the field</i>. (See p. 17, line 26.)</p></div>

It is still the custom to attribute all similar discordancies to the

The scurvy is not peculiar to seamen. It raged with great violence
during the siege of Gibralter. Oranges and lemons were found of great

carry it as an article of provision.</p></div>

In the year 1776, the Royal Society awarded their gold medal to
Captain James Cook, for a paper on “Preserving the health of the crew
of her majesty’s <i>Resolution</i>, &amp;c.” Captain Cook considers that much
was owing to the extraordinary care taken by the admiralty in causing
such articles to be put on board, as by experience or conjecture were
judged to be useful. But he adds, that the introduction of the most
salutary articles will prove unsuccessful, unless supported by certain
rules. The men being at three watches, except on emergency, were
consequently less exposed to the weather, and generally had dry clothes
to shift themselves. Care was taken to keep their persons and clothes
clean and dry. A fire was often burned in the well. The coppers were
kept clean, and no fat allowed to be given to the people. Fresh water
was obtained at every opportunity. Few places but what offered some
refreshment, and example and authority were not wanting to induce
their being employed. These methods, under Divine Providence, enabled
the <i>Resolution</i> to complete a voyage of three years and eighteen
days with the loss of only <i>one man</i> by disease.

<p>
We may remark that our author seems to have been fully alive to
the importance of caring for the health of his company, and it is not
improbable that Cook benefited by some of his suggestions.</p></div>

The expedition of Drake having excited considerable alarm in Peru,

dead or alive. Proceeding to the Strait of Magalhaens in pursuit, he
took the opportunity to explore its shores. He afterwards pointed out
to the King of Spain, Philip II, the importance of fortifying the Straits,
to prevent the passage of strangers. Accordingly an expedition was
fitted out, which, after some accidents, founded the two settlements of
Jesus and San Felipe. The site of the last is now known as Port
Famine: so named from the disasters which befell the unhappy colonists,
who mostly perished by want. Sarmiento himself having been blown
off the coast, appears to have used every effort to obtain and forward
supplies from Brazil to his friends, but, proceeding to Europe for further
assistance, was captured and taken to England.</p></div>

often fallen into by misconceiving the motives of those whose

To hull, is to lie without sail set; to try, with only low sail; whence
we have now special storm sails, called try sails. We believe the correct
expression is “to try” either a <i>hull</i> or <i>under sail</i>.</p></div>

<i>To flat in</i>, means so to adjust the sails as to cause them to act with
the greatest effect to turn the ship’s head from the wind; this is done
when the ship is nearly taken aback, either by a sudden flaw or by
carelessness at the helm. As applied here, it means that the vessel
came round on her heel. The time vessels take in performing a similar
evolution, bears a certain ratio to their length; long ships requiring
more time than short ones.</p></div>

During the survey of these straits in the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Beagle</i>,
Captain Stokes, an active, intelligent, and energetic officer, destroyed
himself, in consequence of his excitable mind becoming worn out by
the severe hardships of the cruize, the dreadful weather experienced, and
the dangerous situations in which the <i>Beagle</i> was constantly exposed.</p></div>

Synnet is plait made from rope yarns. Wooling or woolding is
performed by passing turns of rope round a spar or rope, either for
strength, or, as in this case, to prevent chafe; if spun yarn is used, it

The devastation caused by rats is very great. We have, however,
never heard of their gnawing through the bottom. Indeed if there be
any truth in the old sailor’s superstition that rats always leave a vessel
when in a dangerous state, they must be too clever to perform so dangerous
an experiment.</p></div>

These observations appear to have occurred to our author, in consequence
of what had taken place during the voyages of Magalhaens
and Drake. Both these great commanders, while lying at Port Saint
Julian, tried for mutiny, and executed, some of their chief officers;
doubtless deeming it wise to cut off the hydra’s head at an early period.</p></div>

This must be a misprint; it should be perhaps 56°. Some accounts
state that Drake visited a bay in 57°: this must be erroneous, as Cape
Horn, the most southern part of South America, is in the parallel of 56°.</p></div>

Much interesting information respecting these straits will be found
in the voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Beagle</i>. Since the days of Anson,
the difficulties experienced in rounding Cape Horn have been such as
to cause navigators to look to the passage through these straits with
great interest, hoping, that if found practicable, adverse gales and a heavy
sea might be avoided. Now that the labours of King and Fitzroy have
provided correct charts, the road is well known; still it can hardly be
recommended to large vessels to “shoot the straits.”</p></div>

With respect to the transaction at San Juan de Ulloa, already
alluded to at page 10, Sir Richard Hawkins had good reason to be suspicious
of the good faith of the Spaniards. From the account given in
Hakluyt, from Sir John Hawkins himself, it appears, that “he was
attacked after he had been assured on the faith of the Spanish viceroy
that no treachery should be used.” But in the matter of Oxenham,
apparently, they were not to blame. John Oxenham had accompanied
Drake in his first voyage, in 1574, and after his return, was induced to
fit out a small expedition on his own account: he was successful in
acquiring booty, but by mismanagement he and all his people fell into
the hands of the Spaniards. At Panama he was examined as to what
authority he held from his queen; but not being able to produce any
power or commission, he with all his company were sentenced to death,
as pirates.</p></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
